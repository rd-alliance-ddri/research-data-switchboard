Studies in model organisms, mostly in the nematode C. elegans, identified a relatively simple apoptotic network consisting of only a few proteins. However, analysis of several recently sequenced invertebrate genomes, ranging from the cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, representing one of the morphologically simplest metazoans, to the deuterostomes sea urchin and amphioxus, contradicts the current paradigm of a simple ancestral network that expanded in vertebrates.

Results

Here we show that the apoptosome-forming CED-4/Apaf-1 protein, present in single copy in vertebrate, nematode, and insect genomes, had multiple paralogs in the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor. Different members of this ancestral Apaf-1 family lead to the extant proteins in nematodes/insects and in deuterostomes, explaining significant functional differences between proteins that until now were believed to be orthologous. Similarly, the evolution of the Bcl-2 and caspase protein families appears surprisingly complex and apparently included significant gene loss in nematodes and insects and expansions in deuterostomes.

Conclusion

The emerging picture of the evolution of the apoptosis network is one of a succession of lineage-specific expansions and losses, which combined with the limited number of "apoptotic" protein families, resulted in apparent similarities between networks in different organisms that mask an underlying complex evolutionary history. Similar results are beginning to surface for other regulatory networks, contradicting the intuitive notion that regulatory networks evolved in a linear way, from simple to complex.</dc:description><dc:date>2007-12-06T20:55:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-12-06T20:55:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-10-24</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Zmasek CM, Zhang Q, Ye Y, Godzik A (2007) Surprising complexity of the ancestral apoptosis network.

We propagated Saccharomyces cerevisiae asexually for ~800 generations, after which we measured the change in sexual ﬁtness, measured as the proportion of asci observed in sporulation medium. The sporulation rate in cultures propagated asexually at small population size declined by 8%, on average, over this time period, indicating that the majority of mutations that affect sporulation rate are deleterious. Interestingly, the sporulation rate in cultures propagated asexually at large population size improved by 11%, on average, indicating that selection on asexual function effectively eliminated most of the mutations deleterious to sporulation ability. These results suggest that pleiotropy between mutations’ effects on asexual ﬁtness and sexual ﬁtness was predominantly positive, at least for the mutations accumulated in this experimental evolution study. A positive correlation between growth rate and sporulation rate among lines also pro- vided evidence for positive pleiotropy. These results demonstrate that, at least under certain circum- stances, selection acting on asexual ﬁtness can help to maintain sexual function.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Genetics Society of America</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-12-14T22:27:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-12-14T22:27:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-03</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.18</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Hill JA, Otto SP (2007) The role of pleiotropy in the maintenance of sex in yeast.

Despite identical ages of origin, similar species richness, and sympatric geographic distributions, the morphological and ecological diversity of the superfamily Anostomoidea exceeds that of the Curimatoidea. The test shows with 90% confidence (using variance among species as the measure of morphological diversity) or 99% confidence (using volume of occupied morphospace) that the rate of morphological change per unit time in the Anostomoidea likely exceeded that of the Curimatoidea. Variation in the rate of lineage turnover (speciation and extinction rates) is not found to affect greatly the morphological diversity of simulated clades and is not a likely explanation of the observed difference in morphological diversity in this case study. Though a 17% or greater delay in the onset of diversification in the Curimatoidea remains a possible alternative explanation of unequal morphological diversification, further simulations suggest that two clades drawn from the possible treespace of the Anostomoidea and Curimatoidea will rarely differ so greatly in the onset of diversification. Several uniquely derived morphological and ecological features of the Anostomoidea and Curimatoidea may have accelerated or decelerated their rate of morphological change, including a marked lengthening of the quadrate that may have relaxed structural constraints on the evolution of the anostomoid jaw.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Blackwell Publishing</dc:publisher><dc:date>2007-12-17T20:28:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-12-17T20:28:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-02</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.20</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Sidlauskas B (2007) Testing for unequal rates of morphological diversification in the absence of a detailed phylogeny: a case study from characiform fishes.

It was briefly described by Lydekker in 1893, but it has subsequently been overlooked. This specimen's concave cotyle, large lateral pneumatic fossae, complex system of bony laminae and camerate internal structure show that it represents a neosauropod dinosaur. However, it differs from all other sauropods in the form of its neural arch, which is taller than the centrum, covers the entire dorsal surface of the centrum, has its posterior margin continuous with that of the cotyle, and slopes forward at 35 degrees relative to the vertical. Also unique is a broad, flat area of featureless bone on the lateral face of the arch; the accessory infraparapophyseal and postzygapophyseal laminae which meet in a V; and the asymmetric neural canal, small and round posteriorly but large and teardrop-shaped anteriorly, bounded by arched supporting laminae. The specimen cannot be referred to any known sauropod genus, and clearly represents a new genus and possibly a new ‘family’. Other sauropod remains from the Hastings Beds Group represent basal Titanosauriformes, Titanosauria and Diplodocidae; X. proneneukos may bring to four the number of sauropod ‘families’ represented in this unit. Sauropods may in general have been much less morphologically conservative than is usually assumed. Since neurocentral fusion is complete in R2095, it is probably from a mature or nearly mature animal. Nevertheless, size comparisons of R2095 with corresponding vertebrae in the Brachiosaurus brancai holotype HMN SII and Diplodocus carnegii holotype CM 84 suggest a rather small sauropod: perhaps 15 m long and 7600 kg in mass if built like a brachiosaurid, or 20 m and 2800 kg if built like a diplodocid.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Blackwell Publishing</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-01-02T20:17:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-01-02T20:17:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.25</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Taylor MP, Naish D (2007) An unusual new neosauropod dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous Hastings Beds Group of East Sussex, England.

We used a cross-inoculation experiment to characterize the scales and patterns at which geographic structure has evolved in an interaction between three pine species and one ectomycorrhizal fungus species along the west coast of North America. We found substantial and contrasting patterns of geographic interaction structure for the plants and fungi. The fungi exhibited a clinal pattern of local adaptation to their host plants across the geographic range of three coastal pines. In contrast, plant growth parameters were unaffected by fungal variation, but varied among plant populations and species. Both plant and fungal performance measures varied strongly with latitude. This set of results indicates that in such widespread species interactions, interacting species may evolve asymmetrically in a geographic mosaic because of differing evolutionary responses to clinally varying biotic and abiotic factors.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Blackwell Publishing</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-01-28T19:20:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-01-28T19:20:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-05</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.59</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Hoeksema JD, Thompson JN (2007) Geographic structure in a widespread plant-mycorrhizal interaction: pines and false truffles.

We reexamined this issue in light of a morphological data set composed of 207 characters and molecular data sets of published 12S, 16S, and cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequences. We reach four primary conclusions: (1) Our morphological data set strongly supports the traditional view of odontocete monophyly; (2) the unrooted molecular and morphological trees are very similar, and most of the conflict results from alternative rooting positions; (3) the rooting position of the molecular tree is sensitive to choice of artiodactyl outgroup taxa and the treatment of two small but ambiguously aligned regions of the 12S and 16S sequences, whereas the morphological root is strongly supported; and (4) combined analyses of the morphological and molecular data provide a well-supported phylogenetic estimate consistent with that based on the morphological data alone (and the traditional view of toothed-whale monophyly) but with increased bootstrap support at nearly every node of the tree.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-02-13T20:34:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-02-13T20:34:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-03-01</dc:date><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.62</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Messenger SL, McGuire JA (1998) Morphology, molecules, and the phylogenetics of cetaceans.

Separate data sets of 18S rDNA (1,855 bp), rbc L (1,428 bp), and atp B (1,450 bp) sequences were combined into a single matrix 4,733 bp in length. Analyses of the combined data set show great improvements in computer run times compared to those of the separate data sets and of the data sets combined in pairs. Six searches of the 18S rDNA rbc L atp B data set were conducted; in all cases TBR branch swapping was completed, generally within a few days. In contrast, TBR branch swapping was not completed for any of the three separate data sets, or for the pairwise combined data sets. These results illustrate that it is possible to conduct a thorough search of tree space with large data sets, given sufficient signal. In this case, and probably most others, sufficient signal for a large number of taxa can only be obtained by combining data sets. The combined data sets also have higher internal support for clades than the separate data sets, and more clades receive bootstrap support of 50% in the combined analysis than in analyses of the separate data sets.

We sampled each of the eight species of Adansonia plus three outgroup taxa from tribe Adansonieae. These data were analyzed singly and in combination using parsimony. ITS and morphology provided the greatest resolution and were largely concordant. The two chloroplast data sets showed concordance with one another but showed significant conflict with ITS and morphology. A possible explanation for the conflict is genealogical discordance within the Malagasy Longitubae, perhaps due to introgression events. A maximum likelihood analysis of branching times shows that the dispersal between Africa and Australia occurred well after the fragmentation of Gondwana and therefore involved overwater dispersal. The phylogeny does not permit unambiguous reconstruction of floral evolution but suggests the plausible hypothesis that hawkmoth pollination was ancestral in Adansonia and that there were two parallel switches to pollination by mammals in the genus.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-02-22T16:09:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-02-22T16:09:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-06-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.66</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Baum DA, Small RL, Wendel JF (1998) Biogeography and floral evolution of baobabs (Adansonia, Bombacaceae) as inferred from multiple data sets.

The combinability of these data partitions was assessed in several ways: measures of phylogenetic signal, character support for trees, congruence of tree topologies, compatibility of data partitions with suboptimal trees, and homogeneity of data partitions. Combined parsimony analysis of all data equally weighted yielded the same tree as the 12S partition analyzed under parsimony and maximum likelihood. The COI, allozyme, and morphology partitions were generally congruent and compatible with the tree derived from combined data. The call data were significantly different from all other partitions, whether considered in terms of tree topology alone, partition homogeneity, or compatibility of data with trees derived from other partitions. The lack of effect of the call data on the topology of the combined tree is probably due to the small number of call characters. The general incongruence of the call data with other data partitions is consistent with the idea that the advertisement calls of this group of frogs are under strong sexual selection.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-02-25T16:11:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-02-25T16:11:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-06-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.68</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Cannatella DC, Hillis DM, Chippindale PT, Weight L, Rand AS, Ryan MJ (1998) Phylogeny of frogs of the Physalaemus pustulosus species group, with an examination of data incongruence.

Here, using a complete species-level phylogeny, we construct a multivariate model to assess for the first time which intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (anthropogenic and environmental) factors influence variation in extinction risk in artiodactyls. Globally artiodactyls at greatest risk live in economically less developed areas, have older weaning ages and smaller geographical ranges. Our findings suggest that identifying predictors of threat is complicated by interactions between both biological and anthropogenic factors, resulting in differential responses to threatening processes. Artiodactyl species that experience unregulated hunting live in significantly less economically developed areas than those that are not hunted; however, hunted species are more susceptible to extinction if they have slower reproductive rates (older weaning ages). In contrast, risk in non-hunted artiodactyls is unrelated to reproductive rate and more closely associated with the economic development of the region in which they live.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Royal Society Publishing</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-02-27T17:42:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-02-27T17:42:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-08-07</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.82</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Price SA, Gittleman JL (2007) Hunting to extinction: biology and regional economy influence extinction risk and the impact of hunting in artiodactyls.

The three data sets represent restriction site variation in the inverted repeat region of the chloroplast genome, and nucleotide sequence variation in the chloroplast-encoded gene rbcL and in the mitochondrion-encoded gene atpA, the latter of which encodes the *-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. The plant mitochondrial genome has been little-used in plant systematics, in part because nucleotide sequence evolution in enzyme-encoding genes of this genome evolve relatively slowly. The three data sets were examined in separate and combined analyses, with a focus on patterns of congruence, homoplasy, and data decisiveness. Data decisiveness (described by P. Goloboff) is a measure of robustness of support for most-parsimonious trees by a data set in terms of the degree to which those trees are shorter than the average length of all possible trees. Because indecisive data sets require relatively fewer additional steps than decisive ones to be optimized on nonparsimonious trees, they will have a lesser tendency to be incongruent with other data sets. One consequence of this relationship between decisiveness and character incongruence is that if incongruence is used as a criterion of noncombinability, decisive data sets, which provide robust support for relationships, are more likely to be assessed as noncombinable with other data sets than are indecisive data sets, which provide weak support for relationships. For the sampling of taxa in this study, the atpA data set has about half as many cladistically informative nucleotides as the rbcL data set per site examined, and is less homoplastic and more decisive. The rbcL data set, which is the least decisive of the three, exhibits the lowest levels of character incongruence. Whatever the molecular evolutionary cause of this phenomenon, it seems likely that the poorer performance of rbcL than atpA, in terms of data decisiveness, is due to both its higher overall level of homoplasy and the fact that it is performing especially poorly at nonsynonymous sites.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-19T18:45:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-19T18:45:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-06-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.100</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Davis JI, Simmons MP, Stevenson DW, Wendel JF (1998) Data decisiveness, data quality, and incongruence in phylogenetic analysis: an example from the monocotyledons using mitochondrial atp A sequences.

The musky rat-kangaroo, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, is traditionally allied with other potoroines based primarily on osteological characters and aspects of the female reproductive system. Unlike other macropodids, however, which are capable of bipedal hopping, Hypsiprymnodon is a quadrupedal bounder and lacks several derived features of the pes and tarsus that are presumably adaptations for bipedal hopping. Other derived features, such as a complex stomach, loss of P2 with the eruption of P3, and reduction of litter size to one, are also lacking in Hypsiprymnodon but occur in all other macropodids. Thus, available evidence suggests that Hypsiprymnodon either is part of a monophyletic Potoroinae or is a sister taxon to other living macropodids. To test these hypotheses, we sequenced 1,170 base pairs of the mitochondrial genome for 16 macropodids. Maximum parsimony, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood, and quartet puzzling all support the hypothesis that macropodines and potoroines are united to the exclusion of Hypsiprymnodon. This hypothesis implies that characters such as bipedal hopping evolved only once in macropodid evolution. Aside from Hypsiprymnodon, the remaining macropodids separate into the traditional Macropodinae and Potoroinae. Macropodines further separate into two clades: one containing the New Guinean forest wallabies Dorcopsis and Dorcopsulus, and one consisting of the genera Macropus, Setonix, Thylogale, Onychogalea, Wallabia, Dendrolagus, Peradorcas, and Lagorchestes. Among potoroines, there is moderate support for the association of Bettongia and Aepyprymnus to the exclusion of Potorous. Divergence times were estimated using 12S ribosomal RNA transversions. At the base of the macropodid radiation, Hypsiprymnodon diverged from other macropodids approximately 45 million years ago. This estimate is comparable to divergence estimates among families of Australasian possums based on single-copy DNA hybridization and 12S rRNA transversions. Macropodines and potoroines, in turn, diverged approximately 30 million years ago. Among macropodines Dorcopsis and Dorcopsulus separated from other taxa approximately 10 million years ago.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-19T19:45:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-19T19:45:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-09-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.104</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Burk, Angela; Westerman, Michael; Springer, Mark.

CE sets a base of nodes obtained by CDC analysis and then investigates what further agreement may arise in a universe where these nodes are accepted as given. We suggest that CE75-75 may be appropriate for future studies that aim to both generate a well-corroborated tree and investigate conflicts between data sets, partitions, and characters. CE75-75 is a 75% bootstrap consensus CDC tree followed by combinable-component consensus of a 75% bootstrap consensus of each homogeneous set of partitions having hierarchical structure.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-21T13:50:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-21T13:50:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-09-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.106</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Chombard, Catherine; Boury-Esnault, Nicole; Tillier, Simon.(1998) 'Reassessment of Homology of Morphological Characters in Tetractinellid SpongesBased on Molecular Data', Systematic Biology, 47:3, 351 - 366</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.106</dc:identifier><dc:language>en_US</dc:language><dc:relation>Systematic Biology</dc:relation><dc:relation>47:3, 351 - 366</dc:relation><dc:relation>doi:10.5061/dryad.106/1</dc:relation><dc:relation>doi:10.1080/106351598260761</dc:relation></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The matrix of morphological characters provides little resolution of the A. tessellatus and A. uruguayensis species complexes  but does resolve previously unresolved relationships among other  morphologically defined species (A. globoculus + A. intermedius, A. curtulus + A. planioculus). The morphological and mtDNA characters are significantly incongruent (0.435 ≤ IM  ≤ 0.463; IMF = 0.0735), according to the tests of Farris et al. (P = 0.010) and Templeton (P  &lt; 0.005), probably because of hybrid origins of polyploid parthenogenetic lineages. For the few sexual lineages included in both matrices, morphology and mtDNA provide congruent estimates of phylogeny. In spite of recent injunctions against combining data sets that are incongruent because of differing histories, the results of the combined analyses were used to select one of the most-parsimonious mtDNA trees as the best estimate of maternal-lineage genealogy and to reconstruct the evolution of parthenogenesis under the assumption that transitions from sexuality to parthenogenesis are irreversible. Where cytogenetically justified, as in weevils, the irreversibility assumption is useful for producing conservative estimates of the age of parthenogenetic lineages in spite of potential sampling bias against sexuals.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-21T14:26:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-21T14:26:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-09-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.108</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Normark B, Lanteri AA (1998) Incongruence between morphological and mitochondrial-DNA characters suggests hybrid origins of parthenogenetic weevil lineages (genus Aramigus).

In this study, different methods for treating polymorphic characters were compared using morphological data from phrynosomatid lizards. Clades were identified that are both traditionally recognized and supported by recent molecular analyses, and species were sampled from these clades to make three RknownS phylogenies of eight species each. The ability of different methods to estimate these "known" phylogenies with a finite sample of characters was tested. The phylogenetic methods included eight parsimony methods for coding polymorphism, three distance approaches (UPGMA, neighbor joining, and Fitch-Margoliash) applied to two genetic distance measures (Nei's and the modified Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards chord distance), and continuous maximum likelihood. The effects of excluding polymorphic characters and character weighting (a priori and successive) were also tested. Among the different parsimony approaches, the fixed-only method (excluding all polymorphic characters) performed relatively poorly, whereas the frequency method (including all polymorphic characters) performed relatively well. However, frequency-based distance methods consistently outperformed parsimony, especially with a small sample size (n= 1 individual per species). These results agree closely with those from recent simulation studies of polymorphic data and argue against the common practices of excluding polymorphic morphological characters, ignoring the frequencies of traits within species, and the exclusive use of parsimony to analyze morphological data.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-24T14:14:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-24T14:14:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-09-01</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.111</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Wiens, John J.

The chloroplast data are converging to a single tree, presumably the true chloroplast phylogeny of the family. Unrooted trees estimated from the three chloroplast data sets were identical or extremely similar in shape to each other, mostly robustly supported and there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity among them. The few topological differences seen among unrooted trees from each chloroplast data set are probably artifacts of sampling error on short branches. Despite well documented differences in rates of evolution for different characters in individual data sets, equally weighted parsimony therefore permits accurate reconstructions of chloroplast relationships in Pontederiaceae. A separate morphology-based data set yielded trees that were very different from the chloroplast trees. While there was substantial support by the morphological evidence for several major clades supported by chloroplast trees, most of the conflicting phylogenetic structure on the morphology trees was not robust. Nonetheless, several statistical tests of incongruence indicate significant heterogeneity between molecules and morphology. The source of this apparent incongruence appears to be a low ratio of phylogenetic signal to noise in the morphological data.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-24T14:46:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-24T14:46:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-12-30</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.116</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Graham, Sean W.

We present a graphical approach to exploring the relationship between cost assumptions and evolutionary inferences from character data. The number of gains and losses of a binary trait on a phylogeny can be plotted over a range of cost assumptions, to reveal the inflection point at which there is a switch from more gains to more losses and the point at which all changes are inferred to be in one direction or the other. Phylogenetic structure in the data, the tree shape, and the relative frequency of states among the taxa influence the shape of such graphs and complicate the interpretation of possible permutation-based tests for directionality of change. The costs at which the most-parsimonious state of each internal node switches from one state to another can also be quantified by iterative ancestral-state reconstruction over a range of costs. This procedure helps identify the most robust inferences of change in each direction, which should be of use in designing comparative studies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-03-26T18:12:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-03-26T18:12:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-12-30</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.119</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Ree RH, Donoghue MJ (1998) Step matrices and the interpretation of homoplasy.

This interpretation is compromised to some extent by statistical issues relating to power and experimental design. Nevertheless, we show that changes in expression as small as 1.2-fold can be highly significant.

However, two data sets sampled for a large number of taxa may differ in only part of their histories. This is a realistic scenario and one in which the relative advantages of combined, separate, and consensus analysis become much less clear. I suggest a simple methodology for dealing with this situation that involves (1) partitioning the available data to maximize detection of different histories, (2) performing separate analyses of the data sets, and (3) combining the data but considering questionable or unresolved those parts of the combined tree that are strongly contested in the separate analyses (and which therefore may have different histories), until a majority of unlinked data sets supports one resolution over another. In support of this methodology, computer simulations suggest that (1) the accuracy of combined analysis at recovering the true species phylogeny may exceed that of either of two separately analyzed data sets under some conditions, particularly when the mismatch between phylogenetic histories is small and the estimates of the underlying histories are imperfect (few characters and/or high homoplasy), and (2) combined analysis provides a poor estimate of the species tree in areas of the phylogenies with different histories but an improved estimate in regions that share the same history. Thus, when there is a localized mismatch between the histories of two data sets, separate, consensus, and combined analysis may all give unsatisfactory results in certain parts of the phylogeny. Similarly, approaches that allow data combination only after a global test of heterogeneity will suffer from the potential failings of either separate or combined analysis, depending on the outcome of the test. Excision of conflicting taxa is also problematic in that it may obfuscate the position of conflicting taxa within a larger tree, even when their placement is congruent between data sets. Application of the proposed methodology to molecular and morphological data sets for Sceloporus lizards is discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-04-08T20:32:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-04-08T20:32:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>1998-12-30</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.123</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Wiens JJ (1998) Combining data sets with different phylogenetic histories.

They are particularly suitable for the estimation of substitution rates because their ages provide calibrating information in phylogenetic analyses, circumventing the difﬁcult task of choosing independent calibration points. The substitution rates obtained from such datasets have typically been high, falling between the rates estimated from pedigrees and species phylogenies. Many of these estimates have been made using a Bayesian phylogenetic method that explicitly accommodates heterochronous data. Stimulated by recent criticism of this method, we present a comprehensive simulation study that validates its performance. For datasets of moderate si ze, i t produces accurate estimates of rates, while appearing robust to assumpti ons about demographic history. We then analyse a large collection of 749 ancient and 727 modern DNA sequences from 19 species of animals, plants and bacteria. Our new estimates conﬁrm that the substitution rates estimated from ancient DNA sequences are elevated above long-term phylogenetic levels.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Royal Society Publishing</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-04-10T14:12:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-04-10T14:12:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007-12-22</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.125</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Ho SYW, Sergios-Orestis K, Allaby RG (2007) Elevated substitution rates estimated from ancient DNA.

Recently EST-derived SNPs and SSRs are a free by-product of the currently expanding 
EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) data bases.  The development of high-throughput methods for the detection of SNPs (Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphism) and small indels (insertion / deletion) has led to a revolution in their use as molecular markers. 
Available (5452) Oil palm EST sequences were mined from dbEST of NCBI. CAP3 program was used to assemble EST sequences 
into contigs. Candidate SNPs and Indel polymorphisms were detected using the perl script auto_snip version 1.0 which has used 
576 ESTs for detecting SNPs and Indel sites. We found 1180 SNP sites and 137 indel polymorphisms with frequency 1.36 SNPs / 
100 bp. Among the six tissues from which the EST libraries had been generated, mesocarp had high frequency of 2.91 SNPs and 
indels per 100 bp whereas the zygotic embryos had lowest frequency of 0.15 per 100 bp. We also used the Shannon index to 
analyze the proportion of ten possible types of SNP/indels. ESTs from tissues of normal apex showed highest values of Shannon 
index (0.60) whereas abnormal apex had least value (0.02). The present report deals the use of Shannon index for comparing SNP/ 
indel frequencies mined from ESTlibraries and also confirm that the frequency of SNP occurrence in oil palm to use them as 
markers for genetic studies.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Biomedical Informatics Publishing Group</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-06-16T13:22:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-06-16T13:22:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2007</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.157</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Riju A, Chandrasekar A, Arunachalam V (2007) Mining for single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions / deletions in expressed  sequence tag libraries of oil palm.

Here, by extending Kimura's model of compensatory evolution at interacting sites, we show that the ratio of transition to transversion substitutions (κ) at interacting sites should be equal to the square of the ratio at independent sites. Because transition mutations generally occur at a higher rate than transversions, the model predicts that κ should be higher at interacting sites than at independent sites. We tested this prediction in 10 RNA secondary structures by comparing phylogenetically derived estimates of κ in paired sites within stems (κ(p)) and unpaired sites within loops (κ(u)). Eight of the 10 structures showed an excellent match to the quantitative predictions of the model, and 9 of the 10 structures matched the qualitative prediction κ(p) &gt; κ(u). Only the Rev response element from the human immunovirus (HIV) genome showed the reverse pattern, with κ(p) &lt; κ(u). Although a variety of evolutionary forces could produce quantitative deviations from the model predictions, the reversal in magnitude of κ(p) and κ(u) could be achieved only by violating the model assumption that the underlying transition (or transversion) mutation rates were identical in paired and unpaired regions of the molecule. We explore the ability of the APOBEC3 enzymes, host defense mechanisms against retroviruses, which induce transition mutations preferentially in single-stranded regions of the HIV genome, to explain this exception to the rule. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that kappa may have utility as a simple diagnostic to evaluate proposed secondary structures.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Oxford University Press</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-06-18T16:25:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-06-18T16:25:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.162</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Knies JL, et al.

My aim was to investigate morphological diversity as a possible factor enabling the coexistence of a species-rich Microtus (Rodentia: Arvicolinae) fauna in a hotspot of North American mammalian diversity, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). LOCATION: The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, North America. METHODS: Using in-hand morphological measurements of size and shape, I compared the morphologies of three North American vole species (Microtus spp.), in sympatry in the GYE and in allopatry across their ranges, in order to examine: (1) whether morphologies are fixed or plastic and (2) the degree of morphological character displacement or convergence in sympatric species. RESULTS: Support was found for plasticity of morphology for all three vole species: M. longicaudus, M. montanus and M. pennsylvanicus. However, Microtus individuals of all species from the GYE area of sympatry were more similar to each other than to allopatric individuals of the same species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Competition among these congeners is not manifested in morphological overdispersion. The response of these congeneric species to the same local ecological conditions is convergent. The relative strength of environmental conditions appears to be stronger than the strength of competitive interactions among the study species.</dc:description><dc:date>2008-07-29T21:10:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-07-29T21:10:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.164</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Spaeth PA (2009) Morphological convergence and coexistence in three sympatric North American species of Microtus (Rodentia: Arvicolinae).

We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80% of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients |β| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of |β| for selection on morphological and on life-history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of |β| for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients |γ| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of γ values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.</dc:description><dc:publisher>University of Chicago Press</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008-07-30T14:56:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-07-30T14:56:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.166</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Kingsolver JG, Hoekstra HE, Hoekstra JM, Berrigan D, Vignieri SN, Hill CE, Hoang A, Gibert P, Beerli P (2001) The strength of phenotypic selection in natural populations.

ABSTRACT: The maximum size of organisms has increased enormously since the initial appearance of life &gt;3.5 billion years ago (Gya), but the pattern and timing of this size increase is poorly known. Consequently, controls underlying the size spectrum of the global biota have been difficult to evaluate. Our period-level compilation of the largest known fossil organisms demonstrates that maximum size increased by 16 orders of magnitude since life first appeared in the fossil record. The great majority of the increase is accounted for by 2 discrete steps of approximately equal magnitude: the first in the middle of the Paleoproterozoic Era (≈1.9 Gya) and the second during the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic eras (0.6–0.45 Gya). Each size step required a major innovation in organismal complexity—first the eukaryotic cell and later eukaryotic multicellularity. These size steps coincide with, or slightly postdate, increases in the concentration of atmospheric oxygen, suggesting latent evolutionary potential was realized soon after environmental limitations were removed.</dc:description><dc:date>2008-11-01T15:28:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-11-01T15:28:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-12-23</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.223</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Payne JL, Boyer AG, Brown JH, Finnegan S, Kowalewski M, Krause RA Jr, Lyons SK, McClain CR, McShea DW, Novack-Gottshall PM, Smith FA, Stempien JA, Wang SC (2008) Two-phase increase in the maximum size of life over 3.5 billion years reflects biological innovation and environmental opportunity.

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the ‘leaf economics spectrum’, a similar ‘wood economics spectrum’ may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-02-04T23:35:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-04T23:35:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-02-20</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.234</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Chave J, Coomes DA, Jansen S, Lewis SL, Swenson NG, Zanne AE (2009) Towards a worldwide wood economics spectrum.

Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45%. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population's relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-04-20T21:15:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-04-20T21:15:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-03-09</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.315</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Hereford J (2009) A quantitative survey of local adaptation and fitness trade-offs.

models do not directly encapsulate ecological mechanisms that influence speciation and extinction. A data set of 245 chordate, arthropod, mollusk, and magnoliophyte phylogenies had
a majority of clades that showed rapid lineage accumulation early
with a slowing more recently, whereas a small but significantminority
showed accelerated lineage accumulation in their recent histories.
Previous analyses have demonstrated that macroevolutionary birthdeath
models can replicate the pattern of slowing lineage accumulation
only by a strong decrease in speciation rate with increasing
species richness and extinction rate held extremely low or absent. In
contrast, the metacommunity model presented here could generate
the full range of patterns seen in the real phylogenies by simply
manipulating the degree of ecological differentiation of new species
at the time of speciation. Specifically, the metacommunity model
predicts that clades showing decelerating lineage accumulation rates are those that have diversified by ecological modes of speciation, whereas clades showing accelerating lineage accumulation rates are those that have diversified primarily by modes of speciation that generate little or no ecological diversification. A number of testable predictions that integrate data from molecular systematics, community ecology, and biogeography are also discussed.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-04-24T13:51:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-04-24T13:51:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008-10-13</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.355</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>McPeek, M.

Many of these data sets suggest that Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) is paraphyletic and that Cetacea (whales) represents a highly derived "artiodactyl" subgroup. In this report, phylogenetic relationships between Cetacea and artiodactyls are tested with a combination of 15 published data sets plus new DNA sequence data from two nuclear loci, interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). The addition of the IRBP and vWF character sets disrupts none of the relationships supported by recent cladistic analyses of the other 15 data sets. Simultaneous analyses support three critical clades: (Cetacea + Hippopotamidae), (Cetacea + Hippopotamidae + Ruminantia), and (Cetacea + Hippopotamidae + Ruminantia + Suina). Perturbations of the combined matrix show that the above clades are stable to a variety of disturbances. A chronicle of phylogenetic results over the past three years suggests that cladistic relationships between Cetacea and artiodactyls have been stable to increased taxonomic sampling and to the addition of over 1,400 informative characters from 15 data sets.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-01T16:50:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-01T16:50:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.383</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Gatesy, John; Milinkovitch, Michael; Waddell, Victor; and Stanhope, Michael.

The amino acid composition of different species show significant differences, even within mammals. After compensating for these differences, nearest-neighbor bootstrap results suggest that the tree is locally stable, though a few groups show slightly greater rearrangements when a large proportion of the constant sites are removed. Many parts of the trees we obtain agree with those on published protein ML trees. Interesting results include a preference for rodent monophyly. The detection of a few alternative signals to those on the optimal tree were obtained using the distance Hadamard transform (with results expressed as a Lento plot). One rearrangement suggested was the interchange of the position of primates and rodents on the optimal tree. The basic stability of the tree, combined with two calibration points (whale/cow and horse/rhinoceros), together with a distant secondary calibration from the mammal/bird divergence, allows inferences of the times of divergence of putative clades. Allowing for sampling variances due to finite sequence length, most major divergences amongst lineages leading to modern orders, appear to occur well before the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary. Implications arising from these early divergences are discussed, particularly the possibility of competition between the small dinosaurs and the new mammal clades.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-04T17:40:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-04T17:40:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.389</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Penny D, Hasegawa M, Waddell PJ, Hendy MD (1999) Mammalian evolution: timing and implications from using the LogDeterminant transform for proteins of differing amino acid composition.

Within this data set, we recognized nine mitochondrial partitions (stems and loops, respectively, for 12S rRNA, tRNA valine, 16S rRNA; first, second, and third codon positions of cytochrome b) and 12 nuclear partitions (first, second, and third codon positions, respectively, of each of the four nuclear genes). Four of the 21 partitions (third positions of cytochrome b, A2AB, IRBP, and vWF) showed significant heterogeneity in base composition across taxa. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood) based on sequences for all 21 partitions provide 99-100% bootstrap support for Afrotheria and Paenungulata. With the elimination of the four partitions exhibiting heterogeneity in base composition, there is also high bootstrap support (89-100%) for cow + horse. Statistical tests reject Altungulata, Anagalida, and Ungulata. Data set heterogeneity between mitochondrial and nuclear genes is most evident when all partitions are included in the phylogenetic analyses. Mitochondrial-gene trees associate cow and horse together, whereas nuclear-gene trees associate cow and hedgehog and these two with horse. However, after eliminating third positions of A2AB, IRBP, and vWF, nuclear data agree with mitochondrial data in supporting cow + horse. Nuclear genes provide stronger support for both Afrotheria and Paenungulata. Removal of third positions of cytochrome b results in improved performance for the mitochondrial genes in recovering these clades.We concatenated sequences for four mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, tRNA valine, 16S rRNA, cytochrome b) and four nuclear genes [aquaporin, alpha 2B adrenergic receptor (A2AB), interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP), von Willebrand factor (vWF)] into a multigene data set representing 11 eutherian orders (Artiodactyla, Hyracoidea, Insectivora, Lagomorpha, Macroscelidea, Perissodactyla, Primates, Proboscidea, Rodentia, Sirenia, Tubulidentata). Within this data set, we recognized nine mitochondrial partitions (stems and loops, respectively, for 12S rRNA, tRNA valine, 16S rRNA; first, second, and third codon positions of cytochrome b) and 12 nuclear partitions (first, second, and third codon positions, respectively, of each of the four nuclear genes). Four of the 21 partitions (third positions of cytochrome b, A2AB, IRBP, and vWF) showed significant heterogeneity in base composition across taxa. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood) based on sequences for all 21 partitions provide 99-100% bootstrap support for Afrotheria and Paenungulata. With the elimination of the four partitions exhibiting heterogeneity in base composition, there is also high bootstrap support (89-100%) for cow + horse. Statistical tests reject Altungulata, Anagalida, and Ungulata. Data set heterogeneity between mitochondrial and nuclear genes is most evident when all partitions are included in the phylogenetic analyses. Mitochondrial-gene trees associate cow and horse together, whereas nuclear-gene trees associate cow and hedgehog and these two with horse. However, after eliminating third positions of A2AB, IRBP, and vWF, nuclear data agree with mitochondrial data in supporting cow + horse. Nuclear genes provide stronger support for both Afrotheria and Paenungulata. Removal of third positions of cytochrome b results in improved performance for the mitochondrial genes in recovering these clades.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-06T19:17:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-06T19:17:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.393</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Springer MS, Amrine HM, Burk A, Stanhope MJ (1999) Additional support for Afrotheria and Paenungulata, the performance of mitochondrial versus nuclear genes, and the impact of data partitions with heterogeneous base composition.

A three-amino acid deletion had previously been noted in the eye lens protein αA-crystallin of two species of sloths and two species of anteaters, which represent the Pilosa, one of the two infraorders of Xenarthra (Edentata). This deletion has not been observed in 55 species from 16 other eutherian orders, nor in two species of marsupials and 34 non-mammalian vertebrates, from birds to shark. At the genomic level, we have now detected this deletion in two species of armadillos of the second xenarthran infraorder, Cingulata, as well as in an additional species of anteater. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from a 145-bp sequence of the αA-crystallin gene of 39 tetrapod species, supporting xenarthran monophyly with values from 86 to 90%. To quantify the additional support for xenarthran monophyly, as given by the three-residue deletion, we computed the probabilities for the occurrence of this deletion per evolutionary time unit for alternative hypothetical tree topologies. In the obtained estimates, the six trees in which the xenarthran subgroups are unresolved or paraphyletic give an increasingly lower likelihood than the two trees which assume xenarthran monophyly. For the monophyletic trees, the probability that the deletion observed in the xenarthrans is due to a single event is &gt;0.99. Thus, this deletion in αA-crystallin gives strong molecular support for the monophyly of this old and diverse order.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-08T17:35:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-08T17:35:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.397</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>van Dijk MAM, Paradis E, Catzeflis F, de Jong WW (1999) The virtues of gaps: xenarthran (edentate) monophyly supported by a unique deletion in αA-crystallin.

We test the support for several proposed super-ordinal relationships. To this end, we apply a number of recently programmed methods and approaches, plus better established methods. New pairwise tests show that there is highly significant evidence that amino acid frequencies are changing among nearly all the genomes studied when unvaried sites are ignored. LogDet amino acid distances, with modifications to take into account invariant sites, are combined with bootstrapping and the Neighbor Joining algorithm to account for these violations of standard models. To weight the slower evolving sites, we exclude the more rapidly evolving sites from the data using "site stripping". This leads to changing optimal trees with nearly all methods. The bootstrap support for many hypotheses varies widely between methods, and few hypotheses can claim unanimous support from these data. Rather, we uncover good evidence that many of the earlier branching patterns in the placental subtree could be incorrect, and this includes the placement of the root. The tRNA genes, for example, favour a split between the group hedgehog, rodents and Primates versus all other sequenced placentals. Such a grouping is not ruled out by the amino acid sequence data. A grouping of all rodents plus rabbit, the old Glires hypothesis, is also feasible with stripped amino acid data, while rodent monophyly is also common. The elephant sequence allows confident rejection of the older taxon Ferungulata (Simpson 1945). In its place, the new taxa Scrotifera and Fereuungulata is defined. A new likelihood ratio test is used to detect differences between the optimal tree for tRNA versus that for amino acids. While not clearly significant as made, there are indications the test is tending towards significance with more general models of evolution. Individual placement tests suggest alternative positions for hedgehog, and the elephant. There are striking congruence arguments to support elephant and armadillo together, suggesting a superordinal group composed of Xenarthra and African endemic mammals, which in turn may be near the root of the placental subtree. Thus, the analyses while casting doubt on some recent conclusions, are also unveiling some interesting new possibilities.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-09T20:37:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-09T20:37:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.401</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Waddell PJ, Cao Y, Hauf J, Hasegawa M (1999) Using novel phylogenetic methods to evaluate mammalian mtDNA, including amino acid-invariant sites-LogDet plus site stripping, to detect internal conflicts in the data, with special reference to the positions of hedgehog, armadillo, and elephant.

To try to reconcile these data sets into a single fully resolved orthopteran phylogeny, we adopted consensus and combined data strategies. The consensus analysis produced a partially resolved tree, lacking several well-supported features of the individual analyses. However, this lack of resolution was explained by an examination of resampled data sets that identified the likely source of error as the relatively short length of the individual mitochondrial data partitions. In a subsequent comparison in which the mitochondrial sequences were initially combined, we observed less conflict. We then used two approaches to examine the validity of combining all of the data in a single analysis; comparative analysis of trees recovered from resampled data sets and the application of a randomization test. The results did not point to significant levels of heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal between the mitochondrial and nuclear data sets, and we therefore proceeded with a combined analysis. Reconstructing phylogenies under the minimum evolution and maximum likelihood optimality criteria, we examined monophyly of the major orthopteran groups using nonparametric and parametric bootstrap analysis and Kishino-Hasegawa tests. Our analysis suggests that phylogeny reconstruction under the ML criteria is the most discriminating approach for the combined sequences. The results indicate that the caeliferan Pneumoroidea and Pamphagoidea (as previously suggested) are polyphyletic. The Acridoidea is redefined to include all pamphagoid families other than the Pyrgomorphidae, which we propose should be accorded superfamily status.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-09T20:45:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-09T20:45:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.408</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Flook PK, Klee S, Rowell CHF (1999) Combined molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Orthoptera (Arthropoda, Insecta) and implications for their higher systematics.

Signal transduction is the process by which signals are transmitted from the cell surface to the nucleus or other cellular structures. It plays a fundamental role in regulating a wide range of developmental and physiological processes, many of which are likely to be subject to buffering mechanisms. Here we infer that contrasting selection pressures act on six components of the Ras signal transduction pathway by comparing sequences obtained from 25 alleles of Drosophila melanogaster with one allele of the sibling species D. simulans. The three most upstream components of the cascade, Ras, Drk and polehole, experience strong purifying selection, as they show no fixed amino acid differences between the species and just a handful of rare replacement polymorphisms within D. melanogaster. This portion of the pathway is likely to act as a control point in signal transduction, because the more downstream components Dsor1, corkscrew and Ksr, each show several amino acid replacements between the species. Furthermore, Ksr is nearly monomorphic within D. melanogaster, and application of the HKA and McDonald and Kreitman tests indicate that this gene may have experienced a recent selective sweep, suggesting that modifiers of Ras kinase signalling are the most likely source of quantitative variation associated with this core regulatory pathway.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-13T18:16:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-13T18:16:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2003</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.416</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Riley R, Jin W, Gibson G (2003)  Contrasting selection pressures on components of the Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway in Drosophila.

Thirteen kilobases of DNA including the complete coding regions of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2 were sequenced in 216 highly inbred lines extracted from two North American populations in California and North Carolina. Nucleotide and amino acid polymorphism is in the normal range for Drosophila genes and proteins, and linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly such that haplotype blocks are typically only a few SNPs long. However, intron 1 of 5-HT1A consists of two haplotypes that are at significantly different frequencies in the two populations. Neither this region of the gene nor any of the common amino acid polymorphisms in the three loci associate with either heart rate or heart rate variability. A cluster of SNPs in intron 2 of 5-HT1A, including a triallelic site, do show a highly significant interaction between genotype, sex, and population. While it is likely that a combination of weak, complex selection pressures and population structure has helped shape variation in the serotonin receptors of Drosophila, much larger sampling strategies than are currently adopted in evolutionary genetics will be required to disentangle these effects.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-20T16:13:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-20T16:13:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.475</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Nikoh N, Duty A, Gibson G (2004) Effects of population structure and sex on association between serotonin receptors and Drosophila heart rate.

In order to estimate the magnitude of the impact of environment on transcript abundance, we examined gene expression in peripheral blood leukocyte samples from 46 desert nomadic, mountain agrarian and coastal urban Moroccan Amazigh individuals. Despite great expression heterogeneity in humans, as much as one third of the leukocyte transcriptome was found to be associated with differences among regions. Genome-wide polymorphism analysis indicates that genetic differentiation in the total sample is limited and is unlikely to explain the expression divergence. Methylation profiling of 1,505 CpG sites suggests limited contribution of methylation to the observed differences in gene expression. Genetic network analysis further implies that specific aspects of immune function are strongly affected by regional factors and may influence susceptibility to respiratory and inflammatory disease. Our results show a strong genome-wide gene expression signature of regional population differences that presumably include lifestyle, geography, and biotic factors, implying that these can play at least as great a role as genetic divergence in modulating gene expression variation in humans.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-21T15:23:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-21T15:23:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.481</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Idaghdour Y, Storey JD, Jadallah SJ, Gibson G (2008) A genome-wide gene expression signature of environmental geography in leukocytes of Moroccan Amazighs.

F.</dc:creator><dc:subject>variation</dc:subject><dc:subject>crossing over</dc:subject><dc:description>Regional rates of recombination often correlate with levels of nucleotide diversity, and either selective or neutral hypotheses can explain this relationship. Regional recombination rates also correlate with nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee, consistent with models where recombination is mutagenic; however, a lack of correlation is observed in the Drosophila melanogaster group, consistent with models invoking natural selection. Here, we revisit the relationship among recombination, diversity, and interspecies difference by generating empirical estimates of these parameters in Drosophila pseudoobscura. To measure recombination rate, we genotyped 1,294 backcross hybrids at 50 markers across the largest assembled linkage group in this species. Genome-wide diversity was estimated by sequencing a second isolate of D. pseudoobscura at shallow coverage. Alignment to the sequenced genome of the closely related species, Drosophila persimilis, provided nucleotide site orthology. Our findings demonstrate that scale is critical in determining correlates to recombination rate: fine-scale cross-over rate estimates are far stronger predictors of both diversity and interspecies difference than broad-scale estimates. The correlation of fine-scale recombination rate to diversity and interspecies difference appears to be genome-wide, evidenced by examination of an X-linked region in greater detail. Because we observe a strong correlation of cross-over rate with interspecies difference, even after correcting for segregating ancestral variation, we suggest that both mutagenic and selective forces generate these correlations, the latter in regions of low crossing over. We propose that it is not cross-overs per se that are mutagenic, but rather repair of DNA double-strand break precursors via crossing over and gene conversion.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-22T14:03:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-22T14:03:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.484</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Kulathinal RJ, Bennett SM, Fitzpatrick CL, Noor MAF (2008) Fine-scale mapping of recombination rate in Drosophila refines its correlation to diversity and divergence.

We find that whereas the palatal bones themselves and their arrangements are usually conserved, considerable correlated evolutionary change occurs in the shapes and sizes of the bones.  Some of the changes in the bones are allometrically linked to overall palate size, which varies more than 100-fold among the taxa in our sample.  Often, these allometries were only hinted at in traditional independent contrasts-based regressions of log transformed data, particularly because many allometries are subtle, their slopes may vary among subclades, and the scatter around some trendlines is high. Rather, the allometries showed up in analyses of size-standardized palatal bone dimensions investigated using independent contrasts, bivariate phylomorphospace plots, and mirrored character reconstructions on the phylogenetic tree.  We find negative allometry for parasphenoid lengths and widths essentially across the entire tree of Palaeozoic tetrapods, but with different trajectories characterizing the two largest clades, the temnospondyls and the lepospondyls.  The lengths of several other elements may show positive allometries, either across the entire tree or in just a subclade.  One possible positive allometry exists for the ectopterygoid, which appears to allometrically shorten in temnospondyls that evolve small body and palate size, and, as in Doleserpeton can be lost altogether.  Both shortening and loss could be by the same developmental change, paedomorphosis, a form of heterochrony. Paedomorphosis might also account for evolution of relatively large parasphenoids in both lepospondyls and diminutive temnospondyls, but does not seem to explain evolution of ectopterygoid loss in lepospondyls.  A regularity observed across nearly all taxa in our study set is an inverse correlation between the lengths of the vomer and pterygoid, bones that lie adjacent to one another along the long palatal axis.  Further work is needed to learn whether such correlated evolution might be due to adaptation and/or to developmental bias, and particularly, to learn how correlations and allometries themselves evolve.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-05-28T18:46:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-05-28T18:46:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.487</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Kimmel CB, Sidlauskas B, Clack JA (2009) Linked morphological changes during palate evolution in early tetrapods.

The percentage of supported nodes within a tree is positively correlated with the number of characters, and negatively correlated with the number of taxa. The morphological analyses are based on few characters and weakly supported trees are expected. The percentage of supported nodes is also dependent on the kind of data analyzed. In analyses of Rubiaceae based on the same number of characters, RFLP data give trees with higher percentage of supported nodes than rbcL and morphological data. We also discuss the support values for particular nodes at the familial and subfamilial levels. Two new data sets of ndhF and rbcL sequences of Rubiaceae are analyzed and together with earlier studies of the family we can conclude that the monophyly of the Rubiaceae is supported and within the family there are three well supported, but not easily characterized, large subfamilies, Rubioideae, Cinchonoideae s.s. and Ixoroideae s.l.

However, few studies have examined changes in heterochrony, the rate and timing of developmental events, in an explicitly phylogenetic context. We studied how developmental patterns have changed phylogenetically in the northern swordtail clade of Xiphophorus. We reared individuals of an outgroup and seven of nine species in the clade and followed their development for ~300 days. For each individual, we used nonlinear regression to estimate three growth parameters: growth rate, adult body size, and age of cessation of growth. We estimated sword growth rates in males by linear regression. We then used the means of these growth parameters to construct standard growth curves for each species and to study growth patterns in a phylogenetic context. A combined phylogeny was constructed from both phenotypic and DNA sequence data. The phenotypic data set, compiled from the literature, consisted of 86 morphological, pigmentation, behavioral, and random amplified polymorphic DNA characters, many of which had not been used before for phylogenetic analysis. DNA sequence data from three genes for a total of 1284 bases were also obtained from the literature and included in the analysis. Relationships between growth parameters were examined by phylogenetically independent contrasts in relation to seven different phylogenies based on the most-parsimonious trees generated from the phenotypic, DNA sequence, and combined data sets; this allowed us to identify relationships between variables that were not sensitive to ambiguities in Xiphophorus phylogeny. Our analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between female body size and male body size, and between female growth rate and male sword growth rate, for all seven phylogenies. Marginally statistically significant relationships were also identified between female body size and female growth rate, and between female growth rate and male body size. We relate these relationships to what is known about the ecology, genetics, and behavior of Xiphophorus to better understand the evolution of growth patterns of both the body as a whole and the sword in particular. The relationship of these data to the evolution of swords is discussed.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-07T23:03:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-07T23:03:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.502</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Marcus JM, McCune AR (1999) Ontogeny and phylogeny in the northern swordtail clade of Xiphophorus.

Phylogenies based on molecular data and those based on morphological data both place cetaceans among ungulates but are incongruent in other respects. Morphologists argue that cetaceans are most closely related to mesonychians, an extinct group of terrestrial ungulates. They have disagreed, however, as to whether Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) or Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) is the extant clade most closely related to Cetacea, and have long maintained that each of these orders is monophyletic. The great majority of molecule-based phylogenies show, by contrast, not only that artiodactyls are the closest extant relatives of Cetacea, but also, that Artiodactyla is paraphyletic unless cetaceans are nested within it, often as the sister group of hippopotamids. We tested morphological evidence for several hypotheses concerning the sister taxon relationships of Cetacea in a maximum parsimony analysis of 123 morphological characters from 10 extant and 30 extinct taxa. We advocate treating certain multistate characters as ordered because such a procedure incorporates information about hierarchical morphological transformation. In all most-parsimonious trees, whether multistate characters are ordered or unordered, Artiodactyla is the extant sister taxon of Cetacea. With certain multistate characters ordered, the extinct clade Mesonychia (Mesonychidae + Hapalodectidae) is the sister taxon of Cetacea, and Artiodactyla is monophyletic. When all fossils are removed from the analysis, Artiodactyla is paraphyletic with Cetacea nested inside, indicating that inclusion of mesonychians and other extinct stem taxa in a phylogenetic analysis of the ungulate clade is integral to the recovery of artiodactyl monophyly. Phylogenies derived from molecular data alone may risk recovering inconsistent branches because of an inability to sample extinct clades, which by a conservative estimate amounts to 89% of the ingroup. Addition of data from recently described cetacean astragali attributed to cetaceans does not overturn artiodactyl monophyly.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-07T23:29:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-07T23:29:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.505</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>O'Leary MA, Geisler JH (1999) The position of Cetacea within Mammalia: phylogenetic analysis of morphological data from extinct and extant taxa.

The molecular data indicate that the major life history transition from ectoparasitism to endoparasitism has occurred independently several times within the family while the morphological data indicate a single origin. Similar incongruent topologies are obtained if the morphological data are partitioned by either of two methods: distinguishing (1) characters of the larval stage and female reproductive system, or (2) characters selected individually by the authors prior to the analysis as likely to be mechanistically associated with endo/ectoparasitism. This result is supported by significant differences in tests of incongruence, and we propose that it is caused by convergence among morphological characters resulting from a shared life history strategy.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-07T23:47:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-07T23:47:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.509</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Quicke DLJ, Belshaw R (1999) Incongruence between morphological data sets: an example from the evolution of endoparasitism among parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae).

Differing rates and patterns of nucleotide substitution, combined with the limited information available in any data set, can make it difficult to specify a model of evolution. In addition, conflict among loci can be the result of real differences in evolutionary process or of stochastic variance and errors in reconstruction. We used 6 presumably unlinked nuclear loci to investigate relationships within the mammalian family Tupaiidae (Scandentia), containing all but one of the extant tupaiid genera. We used a phylogenetic mixture model to analyze the concatenated data and compared this with results using partitioned models. We found that more complex models were not necessarily preferred under tests using Bayes factors and that model complexity affected both tree length and parameter variance. We also compared the results of single-gene and multigene analyses and used splits networks to analyze the source and degree of conflict among genes. Networks can show specific relationships that are inconsistent with each other; these conflicting and minority relationships, which are implicitly ignored or collapsed by traditional consensus methods, can be useful in identifying the underlying causes of topological uncertainty. In our data, conflict is concentrated around particular relationships, not widespread throughout the tree. This pattern is further clarified by considering conflict surrounding the root separately from conflict within the ingroup. Uncertainty in rooting may be because of the apparent evolutionary distance separating these genera and our outgroup, the tupaiid genus Dendrogale. Unlike a previous mitochondrial study, these nuclear data strongly suggest that the genus Tupaia is not monophyletic with respect to the monotypic Urogale, even when uncertainty about rooting is taken into account.

Each of the three genera separated in the Enterobiinae fits with one of the suborders defined in Primates: Lemuricola with the Strepsirhini, Trypanoxyuris with the Platyrrhini, and Enterobius with the Catarrhini. Inside each of the three main groups, the subdivisions observed in the parasite tree also fit with many of the subdivisions generally accepted within the Primate order. These results confirm the subgroups previously described in the subfamily and support Cameron's hypothesis in its aspect of association by descent. Although the classification of the Enterobiinae generally closely underlines the classification of Primates, several discordances also are observed. These are discussed case by case, with use of computed reconstruction scenarios. Given that the occurrences of the same pinworm species as a parasite for several congeneric host species is not the generalized pattern, and given that several occurrences also are observed in which the speciations of the parasites describe a more complex network, Cameron's hypothesis of a slower rhythm of speciation in the parasites can be considered partly refuted. The presence of two genera parasitic on squirrels in a family that contains primarily primate parasites also is discussed. The cladistic analysis does not support close relationships between the squirrel parasites and suggests an early separation from the Enterobiinae for the first (Xeroxyuris), and a tardy host-switching from the Platyrrhini to the squirrels for the second (Rodentoxyuris).</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-12T19:22:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-12T19:22:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.522</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Hugot JP (1999) Primates and their pinworm parasites: the Cameron hypothesis revisited.

The nature and degree of support and conflict for particular groups were assessed by separate bootstrap and homogeneity tests that were followed by combined analyses of the sequence and morphological data. Between orders, strong support (i.e., &gt;95% bootstrap scores) was found for a paraphyletic Artiodactyla (relative to Cetacea) and a monophyletic Cetartiodactyla (Artiodactyla and Cetacea) and Paenungulata (Hyracoidea, Proboscidea, and Sirenia). In turn, some reasonable to strong evidence (&gt;85%) was obtained for Hyracoidea with Sirenia, Dermoptera with Scandentia, Glires (Lagomorpha with Rodentia), and Afrotheria (Amblysomus, Macroscelidea, Paenungulata, and Tubulidentata). Otherwise, no other interordinal clades were supported at these reasonable to strong levels. This overall lack of resolution for eutherian interordinal clusters agrees with other studies that further progress will continue to be slow and difficult. Further resolution will require the integration of more recently published data, the continued sampling of taxa and characters, and the use of more powerful methods of data analysis.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-12T22:19:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-12T22:19:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.523</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Liu F-GR, Miyamoto MM(1999) Phylogenetic assessment of molecular and morphological data for eutherian mammals.

Three facts are apparent from the results here reported: (1) different samples of a single subspecies, A. villosa subsp. longiaristata, appear in three of the five major clades; (2) samples of at least one of the six subspecies of A. villosa appear in four of the five major clades; and (3) composition of major clades shows greater congruence with the geographic origin of plants than with the traditional systematic arrangement based primarily on morphology. Specifically, the clades here termed Ia, II, III, and IV each encompass terminals restricted to geographically delimited areas. There are alternative explanations for the ITS pattern, but the most likely one is that nucleotide positions supporting the major clades are due, in some of the samples, to concerted evolution following horizontal transfer (gene flow) rather than to recency of common ancestry. This interpretation is consistent with previous systematic and experimental evidence and implies that reticulation in Armeria may be extensive. Harlan and de Wet (1963, Evolution 17:497-501) proposed the compilospecies concept to account for situations in which a genetically "aggressive" species captures portions of the genome of other sympatric species via extensive introgression. Evidence of extensive reticulation, ecological diversification, and geographic pattern indicates that A. villosa may fit the compilospecies concept, which is here supported on molecular grounds for the first time.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-12T22:28:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-12T22:28:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.527</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Aguilar JF, Rosselló JA, Feliner GN (1999) Molecular evidence for the compilospecies model of reticulate evolution in Armeria (Plumbaginaceae).

Convergence is not inscrutable, however, particularly when one group of characters tracks phylogeny and another set tracks adaptive history. In such cases, convergent characters may be correlated with one or a few functional anatomical units and readily identifiable using comparative methods. Stifftail ducks (Oxyurinae) offer one such opportunity to study correlated character evolution and function in the context of phylogenetic reconstruction. Morphological analyses place stifftail ducks as part of a large clade of diving ducks that includes the sea ducks (Mergini), Hymenolaimus, Merganetta, and Tachyeres, and possibly the pochards (Aythyini). Molecular analyses, on the other hand, place stifftails far from other diving ducks and suggest, moreover, that stifftails are polyphyletic. Mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences of eight stifftail species traditionally supposed to form a clade were compared with each other and with sequences from 50 other anseriform and galliform species. Stifftail ducks are not the sister group of sea ducks, but lie outside the typical ducks (Anatinae). Of the four traditional stifftail genera, monophyly of Oxyura and its sister group relationship with Nomonyx are strongly supported. Heteronetta probably is the sister group of that clade, but support is weak. Biziura is not a true stifftail. Within Oxyura, Old World species (O. australis, O. leucocephala, O. maccoa) appear to form a clade, with New World species (O. jamaicensis, O. vittata) branching basally. Incongruence between molecules and morphology is interpreted to be the result of adaptive specialization and functional convergence in the hind limbs of Biziura and true stifftails. When morphological characters are divided into classes, only hind-limb characters are significantly in conflict with the molecular tree. Null models of synonomous and nonsynonomous substitution based on patterns of codon-degeneracy and chemical dissimilarity, likewise, indicate that the nucleotide and amino acid changes postulated by the molecular tree are more plausible than those postulated by the morphological tree. These findings teach general lessons about the utility of highly adaptive characters (in particular those related to foraging ecology) and underscore the problems that convergence can pose for attempts to recover phylogeny. They also demonstrate how the concept of natural data partitions and simple models of evolution (e.g., parsimony, likelihood, neutrality) can be used to test the accuracy of independent phylogenetic estimates and provide arguments in favor of one tree topology over another.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-12T22:50:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-12T22:50:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.530</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>McCracken KG, Harshman J, McClellan DA, and Afton AD (1999) Data set incongruence and correlated character evolution: an example of functional convergence in the hind-limbs of stifftail diving ducks.

In particular, comprehensive studies have been lacking. A well-supported phylogeny is needed to place the numerous ecological and behavioral studies on marmots in an evolutionary context. To address this situation, we obtained complete cytochrome (cyt) b sequences for 13 of the species and partial sequence for the 14th. We employed a statistical approach to both phylogeny estimation and hypothesis testing using parsimony and maximum likelihood based methods. We conducted statistical tests on a suite of previously proposed hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic histories. The cyt b data strongly support the monophyly of Marmota and a western montane clade in the Nearctic. The results are consistent with an initial diversification in North America followed by an invasion and subsequent rapid diversification in the Palearctic. These analyses reject the two major competing hypotheses of M. broweri's phylogenetic relationships: namely, that it is the sister species to camtschatica of eastern Siberia and that it is related closely to caligata of the Nearctic. The Alaskan distribution of M. broweri is best explained as a reinvasion from the Palearctic but a Nearctic origin can not be rejected. Several other conventionally recognized species groups can also be rejected. Social evolution has been homoplastic, with large colonial systems evolving in two groups convergently. The cyt b data do not provide unambiguous resolution of several basal nodes in the Palearctic radiation, leaving some aspects of pelage and karyotypic evolution equivocal.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-12T23:19:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-12T23:19:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.537</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Steppan SJ, Akhverdyan MR, Lyapunova EA, Fraser DG, Vorontsov KN, Hoffmann RS, Braun MJ (1999) Molecular phylogeny of the marmots (Rodentia: Sciuridae): tests of evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses.

A group of teleost fish, the Notothenioidei, have adapted to these challenging environmental conditions, undergoing a remarkable diversification. In the present study a total of 798 base pairs, generated from partial sequencing of 16S and 12S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes, were examined in 33 notothenioid species representative of all families included in the suborder Notothenioidei. Phylogenetic trees, reconstructed on the basis of sequence data using different methods, indicate that traditional hypotheses on notothenioid systematics and biogeography might be in need of reexamination. Molecular evidence suggests that vicariant speciation could be invoked to explain the early divergence of Eleginops maclovinus, a species previously included in the family Nototheniidae, which is now proposed as the closest sister group to all the rest of notothenioids apart from bovichtids. On the other hand, repeated, independent dispersal through the Polar Front is proposed for the divergence of other subantarctic notothenioid species. Likewise, multiple, independent transitions from benthic to pelagic habit are inferred from molecular data, at variance with the more conservative hypothesis based on cladograms reconstructed from morphological data.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-13T20:01:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-13T20:01:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.540</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Bargelloni L, Marcato S, Zane L, Patarnello T (2000) Mitochondrial phylogeny of notothenioids: a molecular approach to Antarctic fish evolution and biogeography.

The little morphological differentiation among horseshoe crab lineages has resulted in substantial controversy concerning the phylogenetic relationship among the extant species of horseshoe crabs, especially among the three species in the Indo-Pacific region. Previous studies suggest that the three species constitute a phylogenetically unresolvable trichotomy, the result of a cladogenetic process leading to the formation of all three Indo-Pacific species in a short geological time. Data from two mitochondrial genes (for 16S ribosomal rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I) and one nuclear gene (for coagulogen) in the four species of horseshoe crabs and outgroup species were used in a phylogenetic analysis with various substitution models. All three genes yield the same tree topology, with Tachypleus-gigas and Carcinoscorpius-rotundicauda  grouped together as a monophyletic taxon. This topology is significantly better than all the alternatives when evaluated with the RELL (resampling estimated log-likelihood) method.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-13T21:32:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-13T21:32:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.551</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Xia X (2000) Phylogenetic relationship among horseshoe crab species: effect of substitution models on phylogenetic analyses.

A recent simulation study concluded that increasing the number of taxa sampled is preferable to increasing the number of nucleotide characters, if taxa are chosen specifically to break up long branches. We explore this hypothesis by using empirical data from noctuoid moths, one of the largest superfamilies of insects. Separate studies of two nuclear genes, elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC), have yielded similar gene trees and high concordance with morphological groupings for 49 exemplar species. However, support levels were quite low for nodes deeper than the subfamily level. We tested the effects on phylogenetic signal of (1) increasing the taxon sampling by nearly 60%, to 77 species, and (2) combining data from the two genes in a single analysis. Surprisingly, the increased taxon sampling, although designed to break up long branches, generated greater disagreement between the two gene data sets and decreased support levels for deeper nodes. We appear to have inadvertently introduced new long branches, and breaking these up may require a yet larger taxon sample. Sampling additional characters (combining data) greatly increased the phylogenetic signal. To contrast the potential effect of combining data from independent genes with collection of the same total number of characters from a single gene, we simulated the latter by bootstrap augmentation of the single-gene data sets. Support levels for combined data were at least as high as those for the bootstrap-augmented data set for DDC and were much higher than those for the augmented EF-1α data set. This supports the view that in obtaining additional sequence data to solve a refractory systematic problem, it is prudent to take them from an independent gene.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-15T21:22:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-15T21:22:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.558</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Mitchell A, Mitter C, Regier JC (2000) More taxa or more characters revisited: combining data from nuclear protein-encoding genes for phylogenetic analyses of Noctuoidea (Insecta: Lepidoptera).

Approximately 900 bases of the 5' end of the nucleus-encoded large subunit RNA gene (nLSU-rDNA) were sequenced for 154 selected taxa representing most families within the Agaricales. Several phylogenetic methods were used, including weighted and equally weighted parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and distance methods (NJ). The starting tree for branch swapping in the ML analyses was the tree with the highest ML score among previously produced MP and NJ trees. A high degree of consensus was observed between phylogenetic estimates obtained through MP and ML. NJ trees differed according to the distance model that was used, however, all NJ trees still supported most of the same terminal groupings as MP and ML trees. NJ trees were always significantly suboptimal when evaluated against the best MP and ML trees, using both parsimony and likelihood tests. Our analyses suggest that weighted parsimony and ML provide the best estimates of Agaricales phylogeny. Similar support was observed between bootstrapping and jackknifing methods for evaluation of tree robustness. Phylogenetic analyses revealed many groups of agaricoid fungi that are supported by moderate to high bootstrap or jackknife levels or are consistent with morphology-based classification schemes. Analyzes also support separate placement of the boletes and russules, which are basal to the main core group of gilled mushrooms (the Agaricineae of Singer). Examples of monophyletic groups include the families Amanitaceae, Coprinaceae (excluding Coprinus comatus and subfamily Panaeolideae), Agaricaceae (excluding the Cystodermateae), and Strophariaceae pro parte (Stropharia, Pholiota, and Hypholoma); the mycorrhizal species of Tricholoma (including Leucopaxillus, also mycorrhizal); Mycena and Resinomycena; Termitomyces, Podabrella, and Lyophyllum; and Pleurotus with Hohenbuehelia. Several nonmonophyletic groups revealed by these data include the families Tricholomataceae, Cortinariaceae, and Hygrophoraceae and the genera Clitocybe, Omphalina, and Marasmius. This study provides a framework for future systematics studies in the Agaricales and suggestions for analyzing large molecular data sets.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-15T21:28:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-15T21:28:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.561</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Moncalvo J-M, Lutzoni FM, Rehner SA, Johnson J, Vilgalys R (2000) Phylogenetic relationships of Agaric fungi based on nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences.

Gard. 84: 1-49), we present a phylogenetic analysis of flowering plants based upon a second plastid gene, atpB, analyzed separately and in combination with rbcL sequences for 357 taxa. Despite some discrepancies, the atpB-based phylogenetic trees were highly congruent with those derived from the analysis of rbcL and 18S rDNA, and the combination of atpB and rbcL DNA sequences (comprising ca. 3000 base pairs) produced increased bootstrap support for many major sets of taxa. The angiosperms are divided into two major groups: noneudicots with inaperturate or uniaperturate pollen (monocots plus Laurales, Magnoliales, Piperales, Ceratophyllales, and Amborellaceae-Nymphaeaceae-Illiciaceae) and the eudicots with triaperturate pollen (particularly asterids and rosids). Based on rbcL alone and atpB/rbcL combined, the noneudicots (excluding Ceratophyllum) are monophyletic, whereas they form a grade in the atpB trees. Ceratophyllum is sister to the rest of angiosperms whith rbcL alone and in the combined atpB/rbcL analysis, whereas with atpB alone, Amborellaceae, Nymphaeaceae, and Illiciaceae/Schisandraceae form a grade at the base of the angiosperms. The phylogenetic information at each codon position and the different types of substitutions (observed transitions and transversions in the trees versus pairwise comparisons) were examined; taking into account their respective consistency and retention indices, we demonstrate that third codon positions and transitions are the most useful characters in these phylogenetic reconstructions. This study further demonstrates that phylogenetic analysis of large matrices is feasible.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-16T20:11:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-16T20:11:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.564</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Savolainen V, Chase MW, Hoot SB, Morton CM, Soltis DE, Bayer C, Fay MF, De Bruijn AY Sullivan S, Qiu Y-L (2000) Phylogenetics of flowering plants based on combined analysis of plastid atpB and rbcL gene sequences.

In a data set with many taxa, a single taxon that contains multiple phylogenetic histories may result in significant global incongruence, but no methods are available in a parsimony framework to localize incongruence to specific clades in a phylogeny and test the significance of incongruence on a local scale. Here we present a new method to quantify the conflict between data partitions for any clade in a phylogeny and to test the statistical significance of that conflict using a metric called the local incongruence length difference. We apply this method to the evolutionary history of the nuclear receptor superfamily, a large group of transcriptional regulators that play essential roles in metazoan development and physiology. All nuclear receptors are composed of several discrete domains, including one that binds to DNA response elements on specific target genes and another that binds to the appropriate ligand. We have performed combined and separate phylogenetic analyses of these two domains and have tested the hypothesis that nuclear receptors have evolved by a simple process of lineage splitting and divergence, without domain shuffling or other forms of sequence transfer between proteins. Our analysis indicates that significant conflict exists between the partitioned domains at a limited number of nodes on the tree, suggesting that several groups of receptors are "hybrid proteins" formed by domain shuffling or other forms of sequence transfer between more ancient nuclear receptors.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-16T20:31:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-16T20:31:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.571</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Thornton JW, Desalle R (2000) A new method to localize and test the significance of incongruence: detecting domain shuffling in the nuclear receptor superfamily.

This endangered species is a member of the ruminant artiodactyl family Bovidae (cattle, sheep, goats, and antelopes). However, given its puzzling combination of morphological traits, the specific affinities of Pseudoryx within Bovidae are controversial. A preliminary genetic investigation suggested that Pseudoryx should be placed in the subfamily Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, spiral-horned antelopes, and nilgai), but a recent cladistic analysis of skeletal and dental characters allied Pseudoryx with caprine bovids (sheep, goats, musk oxen, goat antelopes, and Pantholops). The morphological and molecular hypotheses differ in assigning the saola to either of the two most divergent clades of Bovidae. In this report, phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from five genes are used to test these alternatives. Protein coding regions, introns, and ribosomal DNAs from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes discount the hypothesis that Pseudoryx is a close relative of Caprinae. Instead, combined analyses of the DNA data and published morphological evidence place Pseudoryx with Bovini (cattle and buffaloes), a subclade of Bovinae. In separate analysis, the matrix of morphological characters links Pseudoryx with caprine bovids, but in the context of the molecular data, the gross anatomical evidence strongly supports a grouping of Pseudoryx with Bovinae. Surprisingly, the morphological partition provides the most character support in the combined analysis. This striking result is obscured by separate analyses of the individual data sets and the taxonomic congruence approach.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-17T19:48:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-17T19:48:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.575</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Gatesy J, Arctander P (2000) Hidden morphological support for the phylogenetic placement of Pseudoryx nghetinhensis with bovine bovids: a combined analysis of gross anatomical evidence and DNA sequences from five genes.

Of the 80 genera in the analysis, 24 were female-biased dimorphic (twice or more the body length of the male); the remaining 56 genera were monomorphic. Under parsimony only four independent origins of dimorphism are required: in the theridiid genus Tidarren, in the distal nephilines, in the "argiopoid clade," and in the araneid genus Kaira. Dimorphism has reversed to monomorphism at least seven times, all of them within the large "argiopoid clade." The four independent origins of dimorphism represent two separate instances of an increase in female size coupled with a decrease of male size (involving only two genera), and two separate instances of an increase in female size with male size either remaining the same or increasing, but not as much as females (involving 30 genera). In orb-weaving spiders far more taxa are sexually dimorphic as a result of female size increase (22 genera) than as a result of male size decrease (two genera). SSD in orb-weaving spiders encompasses several independent evolutionary histories that together suggest a variety of evolutionary pathways. This multiplicity strongly refutes all efforts to date to find a general explanation for either the origin or maintenance (or both) of SSD, because the different pathways very likely will require distinctly different, possibly unique, explanations. Each pattern must be understood historically before its origin and maintenance can be explained in ecological and evolutionary terms. The most frequently cited example of male dwarfism in spiders, the golden orb spider genus Nephila (Tetragnathidae), is in fact a case of female giantism, not male dwarfism.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-17T19:53:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-17T19:53:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.584</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Hormiga G, Scharff N, Coddingon JA (2000) The phylogenetic basis of sexual size dimorphism in orb-weaving spiders (Araneae, Orbiculariae).

These features are (mostly) consistent within a range and different between ranges. The concentration of differences to male courtship behavior and body parts exposed to the female during courtship and correlations between form and courtship behavior suggest sexual selection was involved in the differentiation. A phylogenetic analysis of the populations yields a tree that for the most part groups geographic neighbors, but the history of H. pugillis populations may not be adequately described by a tree. Geographic proximity of apparent convergences suggests that populations from at least some of the mountain ranges acquired characteristics through introgression. Lowering of the woodland habitat during the last glacial period probably brought some populations into contact, but it is not clear if the interrange woodlands would have provided corridors for extensive mixing.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-17T19:59:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-17T19:59:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.587</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Maddison W, McMahon M (2000) Divergence and reticulation among montane populations of a jumping spider (Habronattus pugillis Griswold).

These newly obtained sequences were aligned to each other and to other available orthologues for the phylogenetic estimation of eutherian interordinal relationships. Several measures of sequence difference and base composition were first calculated to assess the major evolutionary properties of the three codon positions and two protein-coding exons of the gene. On the basis of these calculations, different parsimony, distance, and maximum likelihood approaches were adopted, with the most sophisticated involving the separate, then combined, likelihood analyses of the third codon positions of exon 2 vs. all other sites. These phylogenetic approaches provide clear support for the grouping of Chiroptera (bats) with Artiodactyla (ruminants, camels, and pigs) and Carnivora (cats, dogs, and their allies), an interordinal arrangement that receives strong corroboration from other lines of evidence including complete mitochondrial DNA sequences. In contrast, these analyses fail to provide strong to reasonable support for any other interordinal group. This study concludes with specific recommendations about sampling and other strategies for maximizing the phylogenetic contributions of the c-myc gene to the continued resolution of the eutherian ordinal tree.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-17T20:12:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-17T20:12:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.590</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Miyamoto MM, Porter CA, Goodman M (2000) c-Myc gene sequences and the phylogeny of bats and other eutherian mammals.

Independent trees were produced for the seabirds (tree derived from 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), isozyme, and behavioral data) and their lice (trees derived from 12S rRNA data). Brookâ  s parsimony analysis (BPA) supported a general history of cospeciation (consistency index = 0.84, retention index = 0.81). We inferred that the homoplasy in the BPA was caused by one intrahost speciation, one potential host switching and eight or nine sorting events. Using reconciliation analysis we quantified the cost of fitting the louse tree onto the seabird tree. The reconciled TreeMap tree postulated one host switching, nine cospeciation, three or four intrahost speciation and 11 to 14 sorting events. The number of cospeciation events was significantly more than would be expected due to chance. The sequence data were used to test for rate heterogeneity for both seabirds and lice. The seabird tree showed no significant rate heterogeneity over all of its branches whereas part of the louse tree did show rate heterogeneity. An examination of the codivergent nodes revealed that seabirds and lice have cospeciated synchronously, and that lice have evolved at about 5.5 times the rate of seabirds. Sequence data supported some of the postulated intrahost speciation events (Halipeurus pre-dated the evolution of their present hosts). Sequence data also supported some of the postulated host-switching events. These results demonstrate the value of sequence data and reconciliation analyses in unraveling complex histories between hosts and their parasites.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-17T20:24:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-17T20:24:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.593</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Paterson AM, Wallis GP, Wallis LJ, Gray RD (2000) Seabird and louse coevolution: complex histories revealed by 12S rRNA sequences and reconciliation analyses.

Clarification of intergeneric relationships is critical to resolving (1) whether the two Chilean species, Laurelia sempervirens and Laureliopsis philippiana, are related to different Australpacific species, implying two transantarctic disjunctions as suggested by morphology; (2) where the group is likely to have originated; and (3) whether observed disjunctions reflect the breakup of Gondwana. We analyzed chloroplast DNA sequences from six regions (the rbcL gene, the rpl16 intron, and the trnL-trnF, trnT-trnL, psbA-trnH, and atpB-rbcL spacer regions; together 4,338 bp) for all genera and most species of Atherospermataceae, using parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML). The family's sister group, the Chilean endemic Gomortega nitida (Gomortegaceae), was used to root the tree. Parsimony and ML yielded identical single best trees that contain three well supported clades (&gt;80% bootstrap): Daphnandra and Doryphora from south-eastern Australia; Atherosperma and Nemuaron from Australia-Tasmania and New Caledonia, respectively; and Laurelia novae-zelandiae and Laureliopsis philippiana from New Zealand and Chile, respectively. The second Chilean species, Laurelia sempervirens, is sister to this last clade. A likelihood ratio test rejects the molecular clock for the full rbcL data set, but the clock assumption holds for the ingroup. The atherosperm fossil record goes back to the Upper Cretaceous and includes pollen, wood, and leaf fossils from Europe, Africa, South America, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Calibration of rbcL substitution rates with the fossils suggest an initial diversification of the family at 100-140 million years ago (MYA), likely in West Gondwana, early entry into Antarctica, and long distance dispersal to New Zealand and New Caledonia at 50-30 MYA by the ancestors of L. novae-zelandiae and Nemuaron.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-18T20:54:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-18T20:54:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.596</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Renner SS, Foreman DB, Murray D (2000) Timing transantarctic disjunctions in the Atherospermataceae (Laurales): evidence from coding and noncoding chloroplast sequences.

Likewise, systematists recognize that ecological context can have an important influence on the processes of speciation and extinction that create patterns of descent. We present a phylogenetic analysis of 33 species of a North American radiation of damselflies (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae: Enallagma Selys), which have been well-studied ecologically, in order to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms that have contributed to differences in diversity between larval habitats (lakes with and without fish predators). Analysis of molecular variation in 842 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and II subunit and the intervening Leu-tRNA and 37 morphological characters resulted in three well-defined clades that are only partially congruent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses. Molecular and morphological data partitions were significantly incongruent. Lack of haplotype monophyly within species and small levels of sequence divergence (&lt;1%) between related species in 3 of the 4 clades suggests that recent, and parallel, speciation has been an important source of community diversity. Reconstruction of habitat preference over the phylogeny suggests that the greater species diversity in fish-lake habitats is due to the recency of shifts into the fishless-lake habit, although a difference in speciation or extinction rates between the two habitats is difficult to exclude as an additional mechanism.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-20T20:55:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T20:55:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.603</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Brown JM, McPeek MA, May ML (2000) A phylogenetic perspective on habitat shifts and diversity in the North American Enallagma damselflies.

We use mitochondrial DNA sequences to test conflicting vicariant and dispersal biogeographic hypotheses regarding the southern hemisphere range of this freshwater group. Although phylogenetic resolution of cytochrome b and 16S rRNA sequences is largely limited to more recent divergences, our data indicate that the radiation can be interpreted as a number of relatively recent dispersal events superimposed on an ancient gondwanan radiation. Genetic relationships contradict the findings of recent morphological analyses of galaxioid fishes. In particular, a number of hypotheses regarding phylogenetic placement of the enigmatic Lepidogalaxias are examined. While most workers consider Lepidogalaxias to be an unusual scaled member of the southern hemisphere galaxioids, it has also been suggested that this species is related to the northern hemisphere esocoids. Our data strongly suggest that this species is not a galaxiid; the alternative hypothesised esocoid relationship cannot be rejected. The species-rich genus Galaxias is shown to be polyphyletic and the generic taxonomy of the Galaxiinae is reassessed in the light of phylogenetic relationships. Juvenile saltwater-tolerance is phylogenetically distributed throughout the Galaxiinae and the loss of this migratory phase may be a major cause of speciation.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:02:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:02:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2000</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.609</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Waters JM, López JA, Wallis GP (2000) Molecular phylogenetics and biogeography of galaxiid fishes (Osteichthyes: Galaxiidae): dispersal, vicariance, and the position of Lepidogalaxias salamandroides.

In particular, using a number of different measures of utility in both a combined and separate analysis framework, we focus on the distinction between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and faster-evolving characters and slower-evolving characters. For the first comparison, by nearly any measure of utility, the nuclear genes are substantially more informative for resolving diopsid relationships than are the mitochondrial genes. The nuclear genes exhibit less homoplasy, are less incongruent both with one another and with the combined data, and contribute more support to the combined analysis topology than the mitochondrial genes. Results from the second comparison, however, provide little evidence of a clear difference in utility. Despite indications of rapid divergence and saturation, faster-evolving characters in both the nuclear and mitochondrial data sets still provide substantial phylogenetic signal. In general, inclusion of the more rapidly evolving data consistently improves the congruence among partitions.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:12:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:12:49Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.612</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Baker RH, Wilkinson GS, DeSalle, R (2001) Phylogenetic utility of different types of molecular data used to infer evolutionary relationships among stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae).

We explored the use of partitioned, model-based analyses of heterogeneous molecular data in the context of a phylogenetic study of swallowtail butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae). Despite substantial basic and applied study, phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of this prominent group remain contentious. We sequenced 3.3 kb of mitochondrial (COI/COII α 2.3 kb) and nuclear (EF-1α 1.0 kb) DNA for 22 swallowtails, including representatives of Baroniinae, Parnassiinae, and Papilioninae, and several moth and butterfly outgroups. Parsimony encountered considerable difficulty in resolving the deepest splits among these taxa. We therefore chose two outgroups whose relationships to each other and to Papilionidae were undisputed and undertook detailed likelihood analyses of alternative topologies. Following previous studies that have demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in the evolutionary dynamics among process partitions of these genes, we estimated evolutionary parameters separately for gene-based and codon-based partitions. These values were then used as the basis for examining the likelihoods of possible resolutions and rootings under several partitioned and unpartitioned likelihood models. Partitioned models gave significantly better fits to the data than did unpartitioned models, and supported different topologies. However, the most likely topology varied from model to model. The most likely ingroup topology under the best-fitting, six partition GTR + Γ model favors a paraphyletic Parnassiinae. However, when examining the likelihoods of alternative rootings of this tree relative to rootings of the classical hypothesis two rootings of the latter emerge as most likely. Of these two, the most likely rooting is within the Papilioninae, although a rooting between Baronia and the remaining Papilionidae is only nonsignificantly less likely.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:25:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:25:08Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.615</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Caterino MS, Reed RD, Kuo MM, Sperling FAH (2001) A partitioned likelihood analysis of swallowtail butterfly phylogeny (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae).

To aid in understanding the sequence of ecological shifts in this group, we have constructed a phylogeny using morphology, the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, and the small ribosomal subunit (12S) gene. The strong influence of COI on the combined analysis tree was evident from its contribution to the partitioned Bremer support (62%). The net effect of including 12S was to reduce overall tree support. Different character sets resolved different portions of the combined analysis tree, with COI resolving recent lineages, 12S resolving basal relationships and morphology supporting the monophyly of taxa possessing reduced larval feeding fans (oviceps group). The Partitionâ  Homogeneity and Kashino-Hasegawa tests indicated significant incongruence between morphological and mitochondrial data. The Templeton test revealed that morphology and the combined (COI+12S) mitochondrial data were incongruent. This conflict stems primarily from disagreement over the monophyly of taxa with highly reduced larval feeding fans. Either 1) convergence in a subset of morphological characters, 2) low phylogenetic signal among mitochondrial sequences, or 3) lineage sorting causing the mitochondrial data to track an incorrect evolutionary history, may be responsible.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:36:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:36:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.618</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Joy DA and Conn JE (2001) Molecular and morphological phylogenetic analysis of an insular radiation in Pacific black flies (Simulium).

We revisited the previously reported incongruence between the distribution of mtDNA markers and morphologically defined species (Su et al., 1996, J. Mol. Evol., 43:662-671) which they attributed to "type switching", a concerted change in many morphological characters that results in the repeated evolution of a particular morphological type. Our mtDNA gene tree obtained from 44 individuals representing all 15 currently recognized species of Ohomopterus revealed that haplotypes isolated from individuals of a single "species" were frequently separated into distant clades, confirming the previous report. The three nuclear markers generally conformed better with the morphologically defined species. The phylogenetic signal in mtDNA and nuclear DNA data differed strongly and these two partitions were significantly incongruent with each other according to Farris et al.'s (1994) ILD test, although the three nuclear partitions were not homogeneous either. Our results did not support the type switching hypothesis which was proposed to fit the morphological data to the mitochondrial gene tree: incongruence of the mtDNA tree with other nuclear markers indicates that the mtDNA-based tree does not reflect species history any better than the morphological data. Incongruence of gene trees in Ohomopterus may have been promoted by the complex processes of geographic isolation and hybridization in the Japanese Archipelago that led to occasional gene flow and recombination between separated entities. It is intriguing that reticulate patterns occurred in this group, as species of Ohomopterus exhibit extremely divergent genitalic structures that represent a highly efficient reproductive isolation mechanism.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:47:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-20T23:47:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.623</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Sota T and Vogler AP (2001) Incongruence of mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees in the carabid beetles Ohomopterus.

However, analyses of fossil data sets are confounded by problems related to the less complete nature of the specimens. Taxa that are incompletely known are problematic because of the uncertainty of their placement within a tree, leading to a proliferation of most parsimonious solutions and wild card behavior. Problematic taxa are commonly deleted based on a priori criteria of completeness. Paradoxically, a taxon's problematic behavior is tree dependent, and levels of completeness are not directly associated with problematic behavior. Exclusion of taxa based on completeness eliminates real character conflict and, by not allowing incomplete taxa to determine tree topology, the phylogenetic hypothesis is diminished. The phylogenetic trunk approach is proposed to allow optimization of taxonomic inclusion and tree stability. This method is used in an analysis of the Paleozoic Lepospondyli. A single most parsimonious tree, or trunk, is found after removal of one taxon identified as being problematic. The 38 trees found one additional step from this primary trunk are reduced to two by removal of one additional taxon. These trunks are compared to the trees found by excluding taxa with various degrees of completeness. Effects of incomplete taxa are explored in light of the trunk. Correlated characters associated with limblessness are discussed regarding the assumption of character independence, but inclusion of intermediate taxa is found to be the single best method for breaking down long branches.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-21T00:27:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-21T00:27:20Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.627</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Anderson JS (2001) The phylogenetic trunk: maximal inclusion of taxa with missing data in an analysis of the Lepospondyli (Vertebrata, Tetrapoda).

Here we present new data and taxa for four molecular data sets and reassess the morphological characters available to date. We show that there is no significant character incongruence between four molecular data sets (two nuclear and two mitochondrial) but that there is highly significant character incongruence, which leads to topological incongruence, between the molecular and morphological data. We investigate the effects of using different outgroup combinations to root the estimated tree. We also consider various ways in which biases in the sequence data could be misleading, employing several maximum likelihood models, LogDet corrections, and spectral analyses. Ultimately, we concede that there is strong discordance between the molecular and morphological data partitions, and that the conditional combination approach is appropriately applied in this case. We also find for the molecular trees that there are two equally well supported placements of the root, one supported by 16S and 28S sequences, the other supported by cyt b and opsin. The strength of the evidence leads us to accept two equally well supported hypotheses based on analyses of the molecular data sets. These are the most rigorously supported hypotheses of corbiculate bee relationships at this time, and frame our argument that highly eusocial behavior within the corbiculate bees evolved twice independently.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-21T00:58:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-21T00:58:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.630</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Cameron SA and Mardulyn P (2001) Multiple molecular data sets suggest independent origins of highly eusocial behavior in bees (Hymenoptera:Apinae).

Lasioglossum is a major component of the bee fauna in the Holarctic, Ethiopian, and Oriental regions, and is an important group for investigating the evolution of social behavior in bees. Given its cosmopolitan distribution, the historical biogeography of the genus is of considerable interest. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among the subgenera and species within Lasioglossum s.s. using DNA sequence data from a slowly evolving nuclear gene, EF-1α. The entire data set includes over 1604 aligned nucleotide sites (including three exons plus two introns) for 89 species (17 outgroups plus 72 ingroups). Parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses provide strong evidence that the primarily Indoaustralian subgenera (Homalictus, Chilalictus, Parasphecodes) form a monophyletic group. Bootstrap support for the Australian clade ranged from 73% to 77% (depending on the method of analysis). Monophyly of the Australian Lasioglossum suggests that a single colonization event (via Southeast Asia and New Guinea) gave rise to a lineage of over 350 native Indoaustralian bees. We discuss the implications of Australian monophyly for resolving the "Australian enigma" -- similarity in social behavior among the Australian halictine bees relative to Holarctic groups.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-21T20:53:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-21T20:53:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.637</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Danforth, Brian N. and Ji, Shuqing.

Two basic forms of wood decay are known in homobasidiomycetes: white rot, in which lignin and cellulose are degraded, and brown rot, in which lignin is not appreciably degraded. An apparent correlation has been noted between production of a brown rot, decay of conifer substrates, and possession of a bipolar mating system (which has a single mating type locus, vs. tetrapolar systems, which have two mating type loci). The goals of this study were to infer the historical pattern of transformations in decay mode, mating type, and substrate range characters, and to determine if a causal relationship exists among them. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of 130 species of homobasidiomycetes using nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences, and performed ancestral state reconstructions using parsimony on a range of trees, with various loss:gain cost ratios. We evaluated pairwise character correlations using the concentrated changes test (CCT) of Maddison and the maximum likelihood (ML) method of Pagel. White rot, tetrapolar mating systems, and the ability to decay conifers and hardwoods appear to be plesiomorphic in homobasidiomycetes, whereas brown rot, bipolar mating systems, and exclusive decay of conifers appear to have evolved repeatedly. The only significant correlation among characters was that between brown rot (as the independent character) and exclusive decay of conifer substrates. This correlation was supported by the CCT on a range of plausible trees, although not with every reconstruction of ancestral states, and the ML test. Our findings suggest that the evolution of brown rot has promoted repeated shifts to specialization for conifer substrates.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-21T21:43:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-21T21:43:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.642</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Hibbett, David S. and Donoghue, Michael J.

By dividing such characters into subcharacters, their frequency distributions can be represented with discrete states. Differential weighting is employed to counter the effect of using multiple characters to represent one character. The new method, termed generalized frequency coding (GFC), is potentially superior to previously used methods in that it incorporates more information and can be applied to both qualitative and quantitative characters. The method was applied to a previously published data set that includes both types of polymorphic multistate characters, and performed well according to congruence with other studies and the g1 and nonparametric bootstrap statistics. The data set was also used to compare GFC to both gap-weighting and Manhattan distance step matrix coding. On these grounds and for philosophical reasons, GFC was found to be a better estimator of phylogeny.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-22T21:16:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-22T21:16:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.646</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Smith, Eric N. and Gutberlet Jr., Ronald L.

The phylogenetic relationships of fig wasps pollinating functionally dioecious Ficus were inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene sequences (mtDNA) and morphology. Separate and combined analyses indicated that the pollinators of functionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic. However, pollinator relationships were generally congruent with host phylogeny and support a revised classification of Ficus. Ancestral changes in pollinator ovipositor length were also correlated with changes in fig breeding system. In particular, the relative elongation of the ovipositor was associated with the repeated loss of functionally dioecious pollination. The concerted evolution of interacting morphologies may bias estimates of phylogeny based on female head characters but homoplasy is not so concerted in other morphological traits. The lesser phylogenetic utility of morphology compared to mtDNA is not due to rampant convergence in morphology but rather to the greater number of potentially informative characters in DNA sequence data and patterns of nucleotide substitution also limit the utility of mtDNA. None the less, inferring the ancestral associations of fig pollinators from the best-supported phylogeny provided strong evidence of host conservatism in this highly specialized mutualism.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-22T21:20:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-22T21:20:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.650</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Weiblen, George D.

Twenty-four artiodactyl and two cetacean species were included and the horse, order Perissodactyla, was used as the outgroup. Limited rate heterogeneity was observed among the nuclear genes. The partition homogeneity tests indicated no conflicting signal among the nuclear gene fragments and the sequence data were analyzed together and as separate loci. Analyses based on the individual nuclear DNA fragments, and 34 unique indels, all produced phylogenies largely congruent with the topology from the combined data set. In sharp contrast to the nuclear DNA data, the mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data showed high levels of homoplasy, failed to produce a robust phylogeny, and were remarkably sensitive to taxon sampling. The nuclear DNA data clearly support the paraphyletic nature of the Artiodactyla. Additionally, the family Suidae is diphyletic and the non-ruminating pigs and peccaries (Suiformes) were the most basal cetartiodactyl group. The morphologically derived Ruminantia was always monophyletic and within this group all taxa with paired bony structures on their skulls clustered together. The nuclear DNA data suggested that the Antilocaprinae comprise a unique evolutionary lineage, the Cervidae and Bovidae are sister taxa while the Giraffidae is more primitive.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-22T21:32:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-22T21:32:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.653</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Matthee, Conrad A.; Burzlaff, Jay D.; Taylor, Jeremy F. and Davis, Scott K.

When such tests reveal significant incongruence, this has been interpreted as rationale for not combining data in a single phylogenetic analysis. In this study of lorisiform phylogeny, we employ the incongruence length difference (ILD) test to assess conflict among three independent data sets. A large morphological data set and two unlinked molecular data sets, the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the nuclear interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (exon 1), are analyzed with various optimality criteria and weighting mechanisms in order to determine the phylogenetic relationships among slow lorises (Primates, Loridae). When analyzed separately, the morphological data show impressive statistical support for a monophyletic Loridae. Both molecular data sets resolve the Loridae as paraphyletic, though with different branching order depending on optimality criterion and/or character weighting employed. When the three data partitions are analyzed in various combinations, an inverse relationship between congruence and phylogenetic accuracy is observed. Nearly all combined analyses that recover monophyly indicate strong data partition incongruence (p = 0.00005, in the most extreme case) whereas all analyses that recover paraphyly indicate lack of significant incongruence. Numerous lines of evidence verify that monophyly is the accurate phylogenetic result. Therefore, this study contributes to a growing body of information that affirms that measures of incongruence should not be employed as indicators of data set combinability.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-23T01:28:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-23T01:28:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.656</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Yoder AD, Irwin JA, Payseur BA (2001) Failure of the ILD to determine data combinability for slow loris phylogeny.

We present a phylogenetic hypothesis for this genus, based on portions of two mitochondrial genes (12S and 16S). In addition, we reconstruct the evolution of several behavioral characters of interest to neurobiologists in order to illustrate the potential benefits of a phylogeny for the genus Aplysia. These benefits include the determination of ancestral traits, the direction and timing of evolution of characters, prediction of the distribution of traits, and identification of cases of independent acquisition of traits within lineages.

Parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of combined nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-trnF intergenic spacer sequences yielded almost identical topologies, which were used to trace the evolution of the two sexual systems. The African species, which is dioecious, was sister to all neotropical species, and the monoecious species formed a grade basal to a large dioecious Andean clade. Dioecy evolved a second time within the monoecious grade. Geographical mapping of 6,496 herbarium collections from all species sorted by sexual system showed that monoecy is confined to low-lying areas (altitude &lt; 700 m) in the Amazon basin and southern Central America. The only morphological trait with a strong phylogenetic signal is leaf margin shape (entire or toothed), although this character also correlates with altitude, probably reflecting selection on leaf shapes by temperature and rainfall regimes. The data do not reject the molecular clock, and branch lengths suggest that the shift to dioecy in the lowlands occurred many million years after the shift to dioecy in the ancestor of the Andean clade.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-23T23:31:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-23T23:31:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.670</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Renner, Susanne S. and Won, Hyosig.

In this paper, I argue that most morphological characters describe variation that is fundamentally quantitative, regardless of whether it is coded qualitatively or quantitatively by systematists. Given this view, three fundamental problems in morphological character analysis (character state definition, delimitation, and ordering) may have a common solution: coding morphological characters as continuous quantitative traits. A new parsimony method (step-matrix gap-weighting, a modification of Thiele's approach) is proposed that allows quantitative traits to be analyzed as continuous variables. The problem of scaling or weighting quantitative characters relative to qualitative characters (and to each other) is reviewed, and three possible solutions are described. The new coding method is applied to data from hoplocercid lizards, and the results show the sensitivity of phylogenetic conclusions to different scaling methods. Although some authors reject the use of continuous, overlapping, quantitative characters in phylogenetic analysis, quantitative data from hoplocercid lizards that are coded using the new approach do contain significant phylogenetic structure, and exhibit levels of homoplasy that are similar to those seen in data that are coded qualitatively.</dc:description><dc:date>2009-06-24T00:14:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2009-06-24T00:14:57Z</dc:date><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:type>Article</dc:type><dc:identifier>doi:10.5061/dryad.671</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>Wiens, John J.
