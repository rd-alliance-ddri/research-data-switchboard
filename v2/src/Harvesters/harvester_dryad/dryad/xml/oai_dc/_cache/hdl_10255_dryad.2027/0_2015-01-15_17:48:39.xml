Annual plant growth above ground is annually sampled in more than 20 fields from 4 permanently marked 3m x 4m plots in each field. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. The fields included in this study are 4, 5, 10, 24, 26, 28, 35, 39, 41, 45, 53, 70, 72, 77 and the Lawrence strip that was abandoned in 1988.

This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070).  The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger.  The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added.  Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%.  The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations.

	Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \&amp; K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June.  For further information, see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd3.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots.  Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70&lt;! (see E070)&gt;.

	Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture.  Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen.  At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals.

	The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species:  Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC).  Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989.  The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place.

	A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area.  The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource.  Light readings were taken above and below vegetation.  Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken.  A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.</dc:description><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:42:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:42:30Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799255.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799255.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9195</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

However, the dynamics of bacterial community structure and major factors controlling these dynamics remains unknown. Although some studies have suggested that the availability of organic material in streams could be the major factor controlling bacterial community structure, no comprehensive study has been conducted to test this hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to test two hypotheses: (1) Differences in the amount and source of dissolve organic matter (DOM) have a major influence on bacterial community composition; and (2) By exposing bacterial from a given stream to DOM from another type of stream, changes in taxonomic composition can be induced. The influence of DOM on bacterial community structure will be studied by comparing the structures of bacterial communities collected from 11 streams of varied DOM amounts and sources and by exposing bacterial community collected from streams with one type of DOM to water collected from the streams with another type of DOM.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:42:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:42:32Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3043.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3043.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9196</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Sampling will be conducted in Hugh White Creek (as well as, perhaps, Ball Creek) at the Coweeta Hydrologic laboratory.

Project Scope | The Valley and Ridge is perhaps the case example of how rock type and structure influence topography, with alternating layers of bedrock with varying resistance to erosion forming long ridges and valleys. Classical treatment of the fluvial systems in the Appalachians considers the ridges and valleys to be in equilibrium. Relief and form are essentially governed by lithology, and most trunk streams are at grade with their given rock type (Hack, 1954). What has been overlooked, however, is that trunk streams are only a portion of the story. The majority of the surface is actually drained by non-perennial headwater streams (generally 1st - 3rd order), which control the erosion of the hillslopes. Alternating stratigraphy with mixed resistance underlies these streams, in contrast to the trunk streams, which flow over bedrock with similarly weak resistance. We will examine headwater channels to determine if bedrock resistance controls the relief and topography of the ridges, as opposed to drops in base level or climate change. The entire Valley and Ridge fluvial system works together as a coupling between headwater and trunk streams to transport sediment out of the system. Trunk streams carry out sediment transport in the valleys, with the majority of sediment transported in effective discharge events that recur on average every 1.5 years (Wolman and Miller, 1960) and shape the channel. However, headwater streams, which are the pathway for sediment transport from the hillslopes, may require more extreme and infrequent precipitation events to generate effective discharge and channel forming flows. We will determine what precipitation events are important for sediment transport in headwater channels, as well as controls on sediment transport and storage. Holocene climate change and recent land use may cause stream channel changes, if the channel crosses a geomorphic threshold as boundary conditions change. Bull (1979) hypothesized that thresholds of stream power for erosion or sedimentation are important for describing ephemeral channel behavior. We will examine the sensitivity of headwater channels to such boundary changes as climate and woody debris removal and attempt to predict how these changes affect headwater processes and hillslope erosion. For example, it has been suggested that thick aggradational sequences in valleys represent a previous climate in which hillslope erosion by ephemeral channels was more effective than trunk streams ability to transport sediment. By studying how channels function today and comparing this to the Holocene record of sedimentation events, we may be able to get a sense of how ephemeral channels respond to changes in climate. The sensitivity of channels to thresholds will also be studied by looking at the effects of recent modifications to the system (i.e. effect of logging). | II. Objectives: | 1. Determine controls on headwater channel profiles and geometry and how they vary with the resistance of underlying bedrock. | 2. Determine recurrence intervals of effective discharge events in headwater channels and how they vary with drainage area and bedrock. | 3. Determine the sensitivity of headwater channels to changes in boundary conditions such as logging (woody debris removal) and climate change. | III. Our Approach | A) Collect a data set that enables comparison of channel geometry (cross section, long profile, etc.) and substrate to bedrock. This is easy in the Valley and Ridge, where channels cross sections of resistant and weak Paleozoic strata at different orientations. Very resistant layers hold up most ridges, but hillslopes between these ridges and the trunk streams may consist of a wide range of lithologies. This creates an opportunity to explore the equilibrium hypotheses. Headwater channels should be graded to all variations in bedrock along their entire reach. If not, then perhaps bedrock is not the most important thing. | B) Develop an understanding of ephemeral channel function. What is effective discharge and what is the recurrence interval of such events? To get at this we have made some real-time observations of large precipitation events in Allen Hollow, and will continue to monitor this site. We will also do simple modeling of rainfall/runoff routing, discharge and velocity, and effect on sediment entrainment, to see what events are really important for erosion and sediment transport in these channels. Some side questions we may address are what controls channel initiation, what the role of groundwater flow may be (qualitatively), what the effect of woody debris is on sediment storage, etc. | C) Investigate the sensitivity of ephemeral channels to threshold changes. To get at this, we will study channel geometry and substrate in areas of different landuse (but similar bedrock, relief, aspect, and so on) to see if minor variations in things like the presence of woody debris can actually change the channel significantly. This comparative study is possible because of sites of known 20th century landuse and logging history. A second way we can address this is by comparing short term to long term erosion and sedimentation; by excavating aggradational fans at the base of these channels (such as Allen Hollow) and getting rates of sedimentation and frequency of events by radiocarbon dating. This gets at the question of variations during the Holocene due to climate change.1.Survey of stream morphology in watersheds 10 and 34, including distance-elevation measurements the length of the stream (longitudinal profile), general classification of channel substrate, survey of log jams, and characterization of bedrock outcrops. At 3-5 points in the channel, channel cross-sections will be taken and pebble counts performed.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:42:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:42:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3041.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3041.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9199</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Watersheds 10 and 34 - length of both streams from weir to channel head</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Previous studies have suggested that availability of leaf litter influences the rates of decomposition of leaves and wood (Webster and Waide 1982). In this study, we are investigating the relationship between leaf litter availability and leaf and wood breakdown. We hypothesize wood substrates decompose faster in an area of stream without leaves compared to one with normal leaf litter amount. We also speculate that wood and leaves decompose slower in an area of stream with increased leaf litter compared to one with normal leaf litter amount.1.We selected three 10-m sections of the stream for our study. Each section was divided from each other by about 20-m. We used this separation length in order to minimize the effects of one site on another site. We removed all of the leaves from one 10-m section (exclusion site) and placed them in another 10-m section (inclusion site). The remaining 10-m section is used as a reference site. The sequence of sites on the stream is exclusion (most upstream), reference, and inclusion (most downstream). At each site, 20 white oak leaf substrates (hereafter referred to as leaf packs--10- g each) and 15 white oak veneer substrates (hereafter referred to as wood strips--2.5- cm by 10-cm; attached in groups of three to a section of gutter screen) were placed near the middle of each site. We are collecting samples at the following dates after initial placement: 30-d, 60-d, 90-d, 120-d, and 150-d. We take subsamples from each wood strip and leaf pack in order to find decomposition rates of each substrate. Respiration of wood strip and leaf pack biofilms are measured using a Gilson Respirometer. In addition, ash free dry mass (AFDM) is measured from each of these subsamples. With inter-site data comparisons, we will look at breakdown of wood and leaves in relation to leaf litter availability in a stream environment. Also, macroinvertebrates will be collected from each leaf pack. Diversity and density from each sample will be analyzed. We will use these data to look at macroinvertebrate colonization behavior of leaf substrates in relation to leaf litter availability in a stream environment.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3037.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3037.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9212</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Headwaters of Camprock Branch, WS 10.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

The central hypothesis of this project was: The considerable variability among streams in uptake, retention, and cycling of nitrogen is controlled by key hydrologic, chemical, and metabolic characteristics that determine water retention, degree of nitrogen deficiency, and energy flow through food webs in stream ecosystems. We used simulation modeling, field tracer (15N) additions, and an intersite comparative approach to address this hypothesis.1.The field tracer additions were done at each site, beginning in November 1996 and completed in fall 1998. In the two weeks prior to each tracer addition, we made several measurements including: short-term injection of a conservative tracer to determine hydraulic characteristics of the stream; short-term injections of nutrients (NH4, NO3, PO4) to determine relative uptake lengths and potential nutrient deficiency; and pre-addition measurements of 15N in 15 significant stream food web components. The 15N (as 15NH4) addition lasted 42 days. During this addition period, stream components were sampled at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days. Also during this period, stream metabolism (primary production and respiration) was measured

using the whole-stream oxygen method. After the 42 days, stream components were sampled at 7, 14, and 28 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months . Our protocols are described in a 32-page LINX manual.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3038.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3038.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9215</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Ball Creek, 500 m reach upstream of weir 20 | Streams at 11 other sites ranging from Alaska to Puerto Rico</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

WS089 has 759.6 ha, entirely forested except for gravel roads servicing research sites, and ranges in elevation from 701.6 m at the weir to 1600 m at the peak of Albert Mountain. The majority of the watershed has been covered with mixed deciduous forest for the entire period of record except for small clearings associated with raingage and climate station sites and watershed treatments. The two largest treatments were cutting ofg all forest vegetation on 43.7 ha in 1963 and 59.6 ha in 1977. Natural regeneration revegetated both areas quickly with canopy closure occuring within 10 years or less.1.The weir is a 12-foot Cipolletti sharp-crested blade installed in a concrete wall that serves as a broad-crested weir for flows over 3 foot. The first record was collected on Octiober 6, 1934 using Stevens L-Type chart recorder. The recorder was changed to type A-35 on April 26, 1937, upgraded to Fisher-Porter Analog to Digital punched tape recorder on October 10, 1963, and to the current Stevens Type A/E Logger, Model 8901 on August 1, 1994. Weighted watershed precipitation is based upon the catch at SRG40 site just North of the midpoint of the WS08 basin. The weighting factors are 1.040 in the May to October growing season and 1.002 for the November to April dormant season. The monthly totals of both flow and precipitation are the sums of daily totals from Forest Service datasets at Coweeta Hydrologic Lab.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3032.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3032.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9219</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Coweeta Watershed 08, Shope Fork</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

The ability of predators to affect the population and community structure of their prey in stream environments is largely debatable. Four main hypotheses have surfaced to explain the varying results of predators impact on prey, but they have yet to be tested simultaneously as done in this experiment. These hypotheses offer varying predictions about the ability of stream predators to influence prey populations and community dynamics: 1) predator effect prey populations through consumption or emigration of prey. 2) predator effects are swamped by rapid movement of prey into and out of an area. 3) prey respond to predators by hiding; reducing the ability of the predator to find the prey, and potentially increasing localized density of prey. 4) stream predators do not impact prey populations or community structure. We tested these four hypotheses in Ball Creek, a 3rd order stream, with a relatively simple predator community. Two benthic fishes, mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) and longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) and one crayfish species (Cambarus bartonii) are the large benthic predators present in the system. Moreover, previous research has demonstrated that adult sculpin tend to stay in patches for a season. Therefore, by observing adult sculpin we could predict that that area is being foraged by that sculpin. Therefore we could test our predation hypothesis using exclosure cages in areas where the sculpin are located, and in areas of unknown foraging status (random patches).1.Fifteen mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) greater than 4.5 cm in length were observed by snorkeling. We chose fifteen constrained random patches of similar velocity, depth, and substrate composition. Random locations had to greater than 1m away from a sculpin location and were stratified to be equally represented in 5 m sections of the reach. Drift samples were taken at all location using Miller plankton nets for 20 minutes at sunset, sunrise, and midday to measure immigration rates. We filled two baskets with scrubbed substrate, covered one with 5mm hardware cloth, and placed them in the stream bottom at each location. Behavioral observations of a random subset of the baskets were performed every 5 days; all predators seen at the baskets were recorded. We removed the baskets after three weeks, placing them immediately in large plastic containers to prevent escaping invertebrates. All rocks were scrubbed, and all macroinvertebrates and sediment less than 5 mm was preserved for lab analysis. All drifting and basket invertebrates will be identified to the lowest practical level to determine functional feeding group. We will measure all basket and benthic invertebrates to construct a size frequency histogram, and we will determine biomass of all invertebrates in the baskets. We will compare the number, community structure, and biomass between the open and closed baskets in all areas and between the sculpin and random areas. We will also compare the number of drifting insects between the sculpin and random in order to detect potential swamping. Moreover, we will test for hiding by examining differences between the proportion of insects found in the top vs. bottom layers in open vs. closed baskets.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3035.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3035.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9224</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Ball Creek</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Urbanization in the southern Appalachian area affects stream communities based on the type (residential, commercial, or industrial) and degree of development. We quantified urbanization from 1970 until the present using several metrics generated from GIS overlays of land cover, aerial photographs, and field exploration in the study catchments. In addition to land use, quantitative benthic samples of invertebrates and organic matter were taken, and a number of water chemical and geomorphological variables were measured. Invertebrate diversity decreased with increasing urbanization(less forest cover and greater building density). The NCBI values for invertebrates of these streams were positively related to road and building density suggesting dominance by pollution tolerant taxa when urbanization increases. Streams in primarily residential watersheds supported greater diversity than streams in commercial or industrial areas. Physicochemical variables showed similar relationships with land use metrics suggesting some possible mechanisms for the impact urbanization has on benthic macroinvertebrates.1. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a quantitative kick net sampler (0.4 m2, 353 �m mesh net). Five samples were taken on each collection date. Water chemistry, suspended solids, epilithic solids, and physical measures were also measured. Land use variables were measured using NAPP aerial photos, USGS 20,000:1 topographic maps, and GIS overlays (constructed by Paul Bolstad and Greg Edwards at University of Minnesota) of the study watersheds.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3030.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3030.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9228</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>LTER Regionalization Urban Stream Sites: Beaverdam Creek, Crawford Branch, Cullowhee Creek, Haw Creek, Jonathan Creek, King Creek, Richland Creek, Scott Creek, Shelton Creek, Soco Creek, Swannanoa River, Sweeten Creek</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

We hypothesized that agricultural streams with forested headwaters would have different invertebrate assemblages than similar streams that were cleared to the headwaters. To test this hypothesis we compared benthic invertebrate assemblages in six agricultural streams (3 with cleared headwaters and 3 with forested headwaters) in the French Broad River drainage in western North Carolina. Benthic invertebrate samples were collected at three sites along a land-use gradient on each stream. Physical and chemical parameters, including stream discharge, substrate size and heterogeneity, nutrient levels, periphyton biomass and temperature, were also measured along the land-use gradient in order to identify processes which may influence invertebrate assemblages. Land use was assessed using GIS data at varying spatial and temporal scales. The forested agricultural streams have had more riparian vegetation than the cleared agricultural streams since the 1950s, and this trend continued into the 1990s. In general riparian area in forest cover increased from 1950s to the 1970s, although no consistent changes have occurred from 1970s to 1990s. Environmental variables differed between these two stream types, often in response to riparian vegetation but also in response to specific land use. The environmental differences generally coincide with differences often found between forested and agricultural streams. The two stream types also supported different invertebrate assemblages. The forested agricultural stream invertebrates were generally more diverse and more represented by sensitive Plecoptera taxa. Within each season, the invertebrate assemblages at each site were grouped primarily according to present degree of agriculture. The influence of current agricultural practices, particularly heavy cattle impact, interacts with historical forest cover to explain current invertebrate diversity. This may indicate a long term legacy of agriculture, i.e., influences of past agriculture on the stream may persist and influence invertebrate assemblages for up to 25 to 50 years. In addition, the land use immediately upstream explains more variation in diversity than the land use of the entire watershed. The importance of the upstream segment in explaining variation in diversity also indicate that the immediately upstream influences may override the conditions which may be present in the headwaters.1.The study sites were three second- to third-order agricultural streams with forested headwaters and three similar agricultural streams which were cleared to the headwaters in the French Broad River Basin near Asheville, North Carolina. The six streams are located within Buncombe and Madison counties in the Blue Ridge Province of the southern Appalachian mountains. The three forested headwater agricultural (FA) streams originated in forests which gradually opened to cleared, agricultural areas: Heck Creek (a tributary of Walnut Creek), North Fork of Ivy Creek, and Upper Flat Creek. The three cleared headwater agricultural (CA) streams drained areas which have largely been cleared to the headwaters: North Turkey Creek, Pawpaw Creek, and Willow Creek (a tributary of Sandymush Creek). Sampling regime. The six streams were sampled at three sites (headwaters, intermediate, and a downstream site). Invertebrates were sampled (using a Surber sampler fitted with 500 um mesh) in October 1996 and April 1997. A range of physical and chemical variables were measured up to six times during the study. These variables included stream discharge, substrate size and heterogeneity, benthic organic matter, nutrient concentrations, and periphyton biomass. Temperature was recorded continuously by dataloggers at each intermediate site (Site 2) and by maximum-minimum thermometers at each upstream (Site 1) and downstream (Site 3) site.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3031.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3031.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9229</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>French Broad River Basin</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Annual plant growth above ground is annually sampled in more than 20 fields from 4 permanently marked 3m x 4m plots in each field. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. The fields included in this study are 4, 5, 10, 24, 26, 28, 35, 39, 41, 45, 53, 70, 72, 77 and the Lawrence strip that was abandoned in 1988. This experiment was started in 1988 by lead investigators David Tilman and Johannes Knops.</dc:description><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:43:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.7997054.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.7997054.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9238</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data.

Study reaches were 100 meters long, draining similar areas 2000-3000 ha). Agricultural sites were 78 and 87% forested and reference sites 97 and 99% forested. Bedload and suspended-load were measured to assess sediment transport and composition at baseflow and stormflow. Streambed surveys were conducted to determine changes in percent cover of different substrate types. Differences in fish communities were determined from samples taken in fall of 1997. Bedload transport was 10-15 times greater and suspended-load was 4-5 times greater in agricultural sites. Substrate composition was more variable in agricultural sites than in forested sites. Abundance and diversity of fish species requiring clean gravel-cobble were higher in forested sites. Fishes tolerant disturbance dominated agricultural sites. Recruitment of Cottus bairdi, a representative benthic spawner/invertivore, was significantly higher in the forested sites. Increased suspended sediment is one of the many potential mechanisms linking land disturbance and fish assemblage shift. Using Cottus bairdi, we are currently examining the effect of turbidity on the growth and mortality of fish larvae.1.Bedload was collected using pitfall type traps along four transects at each site. Sediment from four traps along each transect were combined for a total of four composite samples per sample period. Samples were dried, sieved into size classes and each size class weighed. Bedload was sampled nine times after baseflow and four times after stormflow. Suspended-load was measured from water samples taken both by hand and with rising-stage-samplers(RSS). Turbidity (NTU) was measured using a turbidimeter and total suspended solids were measured (mg/L) by filtering, drying and weighing water samples. Suspended-load was sampled twenty times during baseflow and six times during stormflow. Sediment rating curves were created using discharge data estimated with Mannings equation.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3025.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3025.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9245</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Coweeta Cr.

. Year 1991 Leaf length data</dc:title><dc:description>There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G
in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e001/e001.html"&gt;E001&lt;/A&gt;, applied at the same time as in that experiment.  For a
description of fertilizer added to E052, see file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  There are four
levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4.

       Level 1: undisturbed
       Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with
the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches
       Level 3: 2 passes or  however many required to produce about
50% bare ground
       Level 4: 3 passes or  however many required to produce 100%
bare ground.  This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in  others.
In  addition,  all woody  vegetation  not destroyed by  tilling is cut at the base.

 Rototilling is applied in late April.

 Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total
of sixteen treatments.  There are four replicates of each of the sixteen
treatments.  In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance;
highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times.
Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design.  Each of the 104
plots is 5m x 5m.

 Measurements taken at E052 will include:  1) species abundances, 2) community
biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground
net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization.  For a list of
treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e052/treatment.html"&gt;trmte52&lt;/A&gt;.

 The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores.
Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a
depth of 50cm.  Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and
poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground.

 In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where
N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were
randomly selected for the competition experiment.  The above and belowground
effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three
competition treatments:  transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1)
with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all
above and belowground parts of neighbors present.  One transplant was grown in
the center of each subplot.  Competition treatments were applied to subplots
within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990.  Competition treatments were
replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four
combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance.  Thus, the 40 plots of
the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance
levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x
3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition
treatment.  A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted.  Competition
treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot.

 In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and
positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were
used:  Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis.
Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2)
no neighbors.  The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient
environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and
the species.  There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments,
one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at
17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2
competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2
environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.  Seedlings were
transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.</dc:description><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.419152.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.419152.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9254</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data.

Study reaches were 100 meters long, draining similar areas (2000-3000 ha). Agricultural sites were 78 and 87% forested and reference sites 97 and 99% forested. Bedload and suspended-load were measured to assess sediment transport and composition at baseflow and stormflow. Streambed surveys were conducted to determine changes in percent cover of different substrate types. Differences in fish communities were determined from samples taken in fall of 1997. Bedload transport was 10-15 times greater and suspended-load was 4-5 times greater in agricultural sites. Substrate composition was more variable in agricultural sites than in forested sites. Abundance and diversity of fish species requiring clean gravel-cobble were higher at forested sites. Fishes tolerant of disturbance dominated agricultural sites. Recruitment of Cottus bairdi, a representative benthic spawner/invertivore, was significantly higher in forested sites. Increased suspended sediment in one of many potential mechanisms linking land disturbance and fish assemblage shift. Using Cottus bairdi, we are currently examining the effect of increased turbidity on the growth and mortality of fish larvae.1.Fish were sampled at all four sites using a backpack electroshocker and 1/8" mesh seine net. Two passes were made at each 100m site. Fish were identified in the field. Fish we were unsure of were brought back to be identified in the lab. Each fish was weighed and the standard length measured.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3023.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3023.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9257</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>LTER augmentation sites: Coweeta Cr.

Substrate data was collected three times over a period of seven months. Estimates were taken at 1 meter intervals along each transect by looking through a 20cm x 20cm viewbox. Substrate was divided into one of six catagories (silt, sand, gravel, cobble, boulder and bedrock). Upon analysis data for each sample location were divided into one of four catagories (silt/sand, gravel/cobble, boulder/bedrock and mixed). Between-site differences in dominance of substrate catagories were determined. We also examined the change over time of substrate dominance to assess between-site differences in streambed

stability. Other habitat measures taken at each sampling location were average velocity and depth.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:44:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3024.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3024.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9259</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>LTER augmentation sites: Coweeta Cr.

At the scale of individual stones, we failed to detect a significant correlation between prey density/stone and longnose dace for aging effort (# bites/stone), even though there were large differences (i.e. up to 200x) in prey density among individual stones. At the foraging patch scale, longnose dace chose patches with significanlty greater prey densities than were available from randomly selected stones in summer and spring, when prey were distributed in distinct patches, but did not select high-prey patches in fall, when prey were uniformly distributed. In addition, longnose dace avoided patches with depositional physical characteristics in all seasons. At the reach scale, longnose dace were signficnatly under-represented in depositional reaches in all seasons. Among erosional reaches, prey density was significantly different among reaches in all seasons, and prey density/reach was positively correlated with longnose dace density/reach in all seasons. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of physical variable and prey concurrently affect habitat use by longnose dace at multiple scales.1.Samples were collected along transect lines established at 4m intervals between permanent transect posts. A 1m� grid composed of 25 400cm� squares was placed upon the stream at 1m intervals along each transect line. 1 of the 25 squares was randomly selected and macroinvertebrates were collected from the stone closest to the center of each square with a Surber sampler.  In the lab, depending on sample size, either 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, or all macroinvertebrates were identified to family and their head capsule width (distance accross eyes) was measured using a dissecting microscope and micrometer. Family specific regressions between head capsule width and volume were used to estimate macroinvertebrate volume.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3014.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3014.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9278</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Watershed 9, Ball Creek, 100m section directly above weir 9</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

At the scale of individual stones, we failed to detect a significant correlation between prey density/stone and longnose dace for aging effort (# bites/stone), even though there were large differences (i.e. up to 200x) in prey density among individual stones. At the foraging patch scale, longnose dace chose patches with significanlty greater prey densities than were available from randomly selected stones in summer and spring, when prey were distributed in distinct patches, but did not select high-prey patches in fall, when prey were uniformly distributed. In addition, longnose dace avoided patches with depositional physical characteristics in all seasons. At the reach scale, longnose dace were signficnatly under-represented in depositional reaches in all seasons. Among erosional reaches, prey density was significantly different among reaches in all seasons, and prey density/reach was positively correlated with longnose dace density/reach in all seasons. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of physical variable and prey concurrently affect habitat use by longnose dace at multiple scales.1.Data were collected by directly observing actively foraging longnose dace through snorkeling. We snorkeled the site until 20 longnose dace had been observed in each season. We observed each longnose dace until it had foraged upon 4-5 stones, recoreded the number of bites taken from each stone, and placed brightly colored lead weights adjacent to each stone. Once 20 fish had been observed, collected macroinvertebrates from each foraged-upon stone with a Surber sampler. In the lab, depending on sample size, either 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, or all macroinvertebrates were identified to family and their head capsule width (distance accross eyes) was measured using a dissecting microscope and micrometer. Family specific regressions between head capsule width and volume were used to estimate macroinvertebrate volume.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3015.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3015.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9282</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Watershed 9, Ball Creek, 100m section directly above weir 9</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W
