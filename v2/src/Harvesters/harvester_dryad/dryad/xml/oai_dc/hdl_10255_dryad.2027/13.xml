The site is vegetated by dwarf shrubs of Ericads and Betula.  Initially the station was operational from late May/early June through August. In 1993 the station became year round. Any missing May through October average air temperature data were estimated using regressions with the Toolik Field Station weather station (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W).  For a description of the site see Shaver, et al. 1996.
In addition to air temperature and wind speed which are reported here, global incoming radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperatures and wind direction were recorded.  See the hourly data files.

(9) EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS In the summer of 1987 a weather station was placed on an old floodplain terrace about 200 m from the Sagavanirktok River.  The site is vegetated by dwarf shrubs of Ericads and Betula.  Initially the station was operational from late May/early June through August. In 1993 the station became year round. Any missing May through October average air temperature data were estimated using regressions with the Toolik Field Station weather station (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W).  For a description of the site see Shaver, et al. 1996.
In addition to air temperature and wind speed which are reported here, global incoming radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperatures and wind direction were recorded.  See the hourly data files.

(9) EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS In the summer of 1987 a weather station was placed on an old floodplain terrace about 200 m from the Sagavanirktok River.  The site is vegetated by dwarf shrubs of Ericads and Betula.  Initially the station was operational from late May/early June through August. In 1993 the station became year round. Any missing May through October average air temperature data were estimated using regressions with the Toolik Field Station weather station (68 degrees 38'N, 149 degrees 36'W).  For a description of the site see Shaver, et al. 1996.
In addition to air temperature and wind speed which are reported here, global incoming radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperatures and wind direction were recorded.  See the hourly data files.

The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in fomalin, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species.

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-81.493498 W

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island.

Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested.

Crab abundance was determined by counting the number of crab holes within a 625 cm^2 quadrat and converting the counts to number per square meter. Counts were made in the mid-marsh and creek bank zones (n = 4 per zone) at GCE sites 1 through 10. This method does not differentiate which species made a particular hole and therefore only estimates total crab abundance. Plugged holes were excluded from the counts. Mean density across all sites and zones was 342 m^-2 (+/- 355 s.d.).</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KennethHelm</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielSaucedo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>GalenKaufman</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>BernardKenemer</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JennyFenton</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2008</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:33:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:33:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.298.13/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.298.13</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10635</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-0705b, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

It is a mosaic of uplands dominated by oak savanna, prairie, hardwood forest, pine forests,and abandoned agricultural fields and of lowlands comprised of ash and cedar swamps, acid bogs, marshes, and sedge meadows. Large tracts of the pre-agricultural ecosystems of the region are preserved within its boundaries, as is a successional chronosequence of more than 80 old fields of known history.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-93.22445 W

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1988</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:34:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:34:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.408601.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.408601.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10662</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

CCNHA lies at the boundary between prairie and forest. It is a mosaic of uplands dominated by oak savanna, prairie, hardwood forest, pine forests,and abandoned agricultural fields and of lowlands comprised of ash and cedar swamps, acid bogs, marshes, and sedge meadows. Large tracts of the pre-agricultural ecosystems of the region are preserved within its boundaries, as is a successional chronosequence of more than 80 old fields of known history.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-93.22445 W

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
