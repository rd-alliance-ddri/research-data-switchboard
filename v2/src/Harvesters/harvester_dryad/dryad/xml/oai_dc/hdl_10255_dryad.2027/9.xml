The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:16:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:16:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799101.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799101.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10193</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.</dc:description><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799102.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799102.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10194</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

One was located near the creek bank, one in the mid-marsh and one in the high marsh. On Hog Island, four loggers were located at the edge of the marsh, in the adjacent shrub thicket, near a freshwater pond in the center of the island and in an adjacent thicket (running from the bay towards the ocean side of the island). Water levels were recorded in wells using WL40 level loggers. The WL40 units have a sealed data logger attached to a conductive wire that runs along a plastic pole. When inserted into a well, the logger records the amount of the wire that is submersed, based on capacitance. The advantage of this method is that it is insensitive to atmospheric pressure changes or to changes in water salinity. Data is dumped via an optical interface to a calculator.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research ProjectDepartment of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, 291 McCormick Road, PO Box 400123CharlottesvilleVA22904-4123USA434-924-7761434-982-2137http://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-vcr.142.5/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-vcr.142.5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10201</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Brownsville Marsh, Eastern Shore - Brownsville Marsh, Eastern Shore</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Brownsville Well - Creekbank (BC) - Brownsville Well - Creekbank (BC)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Brownsville Well - High Marsh (BH) - Brownsville Well - High Marsh (BH)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Brownsville Well - Mid Marsh (BM) - Brownsville Well - Mid Marsh (BM)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Brownsville Well - High Marsh Tracy1 (Tracy1) - Brownsville Well - High Marsh Tracy1 (Tracy1)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Brownsville Well - High Marsh Tracy2 (Tracy2) - Brownsville Well - High Marsh Tracy2 (Tracy2)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>North Hog Island (chronosequence) - North Hog Island (chronosequence)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-75.827000 W

events observable in a plants life : germinating, vegetating, budding
(flowers), flowering, fruiting, dormant, dying, and dead.  All
transects were placed close to Sevilleta LTER meteorological stations.
The phenological information collected will give researchers baseline
data for use in plant reproductive or phenological studies.  The
proximity of sites to weather stations allows coupling of biotic and
abiotic data to ascertain cause and effect relationships of climate
and plant growth.  Monitoring these sites through time will allow
researchers to see how the timing of different events changes from
year to year and over many years.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Sevilleta Long Term Ecological ResearchDepartment of Biology167 Castetter Hall1 University of New MexicoAlbuquerqueNew Mexico87131-0001USA505-277-5355</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>TroyMaddux</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MelissaChavez</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MikeBradley</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MonicaValdez</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:17Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.04892.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-sev.04892.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10202</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>* Sevilleta LTER Project Area Description
		
		The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge is in Socorro County in central New Mexico.  
		The Sevilleta is almost 100,000 ha of land that has floristic influences from the
		Chihuahuan Desert to the south, the Great Plains grassland from the east, The 
		Great Basin Desert from the northwest, and montane vegetation as one moves up in elevation. 

	* Study Area Description
	
		RIO SALADO - This is a very sandy site.  The predominate grasses are Oryzopsis 
		hymenoides, Hilaria jamesii, and Sporobolus flexuosus. The shrubs include 
		four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosus), indigo
 		bush (Dalea scoparia), Penstemon ambiguus and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata).
		The herbaceous vegetation includes Cassia bauhinioides, Thelesperma megapotamicum, 
		and Zinnia grandiflora.

                DEEP WELL - The deep well site is west of the missile range road, between the road 
		and the deep well meteorological station. This is a grassland site with grasses from 
		the shortgrass prairie such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and grasses with a more 
		southern affinity such as black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Other grasses found at 
		the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns (Aristida spp.). Shrubs 
		are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing 
		saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus
		filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

		GOAT DRAW - This is a pinyon/juniper site in the Los Pinos mountains. Transect #1 runs 
		across the rocky hillslopes and through two rocky washes. Transect #2 runs along a 
		gravelly stream bed. Transect #1 is covered with pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper
		(Juniperus monosperma) trees and shrubs that include beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), 
		feather dalea (Dalea formosa), shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella), and brown-spined 
		prickly pear (Opuntia phaeacantha). The grasses include hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), 
		bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua
		curtipendula). The second transect has shrubs that include cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata) 
		and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and many herbs such as Verbena wrightii, 
		Erodium cicutarium, and Lesquerella ovalifolia.

		WATERSHEDS - The transects in this site criss-cross a gravelly ephemeral stream 
		bed in the foothills of the Los Pinos Mountains. The woody vegetation in this 
		stream bed includes Junipers (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache 
		plume (Fallugia paradoxa). On the hills are Junipers and shrubs such as cane 
		cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo
		(Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and 
		Mirabilis multiflora.  The grasses found at this site include three-awn (Aristida sp.), 
		fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum, and four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.). 

		TRANSECT DESCRIPTION -  Three of the sites have three transects and one site has
 		four transects. Black Butte, Deep Well, and Five Points each have three transects.
	  	The transects are 100 meters long, about 20 meters apart, and have a roughly a north/south 
		azimuth. The transects are situated to capture the vegetation that dominates and
	  	characterizes each site.  Sepultura has four transects, each running from the shelf above 
		the stream channel, across the channel to the other shelf. These transects are 50 meters 
		long and situated to capture the diversity of  plants in the wash, up the banks, and on 
		the shelf.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>* Sevilleta LTER Project Area Description
		
		The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge is in Socorro County in central New Mexico.  
		The Sevilleta is almost 100,000 ha of land that has floristic influences from the

	  The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge is in Socorro County in central New Mexico.  
	  The Sevilleta is almost 100,000 ha of land that has floristic influences from the
	  Chihuahuan Desert to the south, the Great Plains grassland from the east, The Great 
	  Basin Desert from the northwest, and montane vegetation as one moves up in elevation. 

	* Study Area Description
	  
	  RIO SALADO - This is a very sandy site.  The predominate grasses are Oryzopsis hymenoides, 
	  Hilaria jamesii, and Sporobolus flexuosus. The shrubs include four-wing saltbush (Atriplex
	  canescens), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosus), indigo bush (Dalea scoparia), Penstemon ambiguus 
	  and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). The herbaceous vegetation includes Cassia bauhinioides, 
	  Thelesperma megapotamicum, and Zinnia grandiflora.

          DEEP WELL - The deep well site is west of the missile range road, between the road and the deep 
	  well meteorological station. This is a grassland site with grasses from the shortgrass prairie such
	  as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and grasses with a more southern affinity such as black grama 
	  (Bouteloua eriopoda).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and 
	  threeawns (Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra 
	  torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, 
	  Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

	  GOAT DRAW - This is a pinyon/juniper site in the Los Pinos mountains.  Transect #1 runs across the rocky 
	  hillslopes and through two rocky washes.  Transect #2 runs along a gravelly stream
	  bed. Transect #1 is covered with pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) trees and shrubs 
	  that include beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), feather dalea (Dalea formosa), shrub live oak (Quercus
	  turbinella), and brown-spined prickly pear (Opuntia phaeacantha). The grasses include hairy grama 
	  (Bouteloua hirsuta), bottlebrush squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua
	  curtipendula).  The second transect has shrubs that include cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens)
	  and many herbs such as Verbena wrightii, Erodium cicutarium, and Lesquerella ovalifolia.

	  WATERSHEDS - The transects in this site criss-cross a gravelly ephemeral stream bed in the foothills of 
	  the Los Pinos Mountains.  The woody vegetation in this stream bed includes Junipers
  	  (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa).  On the hills are 
	  Junipers and shrubs such as cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo
	  (Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and Mirabilis multiflora.  The 
	  grasses found at this site include three-awn (Aristida sp.), fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum,
	  and  four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.). 

	  TRANSECT DESCRIPTION -  Three of the sites have three transects and one site has four transects.  Black Butte,
	  Deep Well, and Five Points each have three transects. The transects are 100 meters long, about 20 meters apart,
	  and have a roughly a north/south azimuth.  The transects are situated to capture the vegetation that dominates 
	  and characterizes each site.  Sepultura has four transects, each running from the shelf above the stream channel, 
	  across the channel to the other shelf. These transects are 50 meters long and situated to capture the diversity of  
	  plants in the wash, up the banks, and on the shelf.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>* Sevilleta LTER Project Area Description

	  cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and many herbs such as Verbena wrightii, Erodium cicutarium, and
	  Lesquerella ovalifolia.

	  WATERSHEDS - The transects in this site criss-cross a gravelly ephemeral stream bed in the foothills of the Los Pinos
	  Mountains.  The woody vegetation in this stream bed includes Junipers (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache plume (Fallugia
	  paradoxa).  On the hills are Junipers and shrubs such as cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo
	  (Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and Mirabilis multiflora.  The grasses found at this site
	  include three-awn (Aristida sp.), fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum, and four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.).

	  TRANSECT DESCRIPTION -  Three of the sites have three transects and one site has four transects.  Black Butte,
	  Deep Well, and Five Points each have three transects. The transects are 100 meters long, about 20 meters apart,
	  and have a roughly a north/south azimuth.  The transects are situated to capture the vegetation that dominates and
	  characterizes each site.  Sepultura has four transects, each running from the shelf above the stream channel, across the
	  channel to the other shelf. These transects are 50 meters long and situated to capture the diversity of  plants in the
	  wash, up the banks, and on the shelf.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-107.089501 W

events observable in a plants life : germinating, vegetating, budding
(flowers), flowering, fruiting, dormant, dying, and dead.  All
transects were placed close to Sevilleta LTER meteorological stations.
The phenological information collected will give researchers baseline
data for use in plant reproductive or phenological studies.  The
proximity of sites to weather stations allows coupling of biotic and
abiotic data to ascertain cause and effect relationships of climate
and plant growth.  Monitoring these sites through time will allow
researchers to see how the timing of different events changes from
year to year and over many years.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Sevilleta Long Term Ecological ResearchDepartment of Biology167 Castetter Hall1 University of New MexicoAlbuquerqueNew Mexico87131-0001USA505-277-5355</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:17:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.04895.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-sev.04895.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10210</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>* Sevilleta LTER Project Area Description

		The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge is in Socorro County in central New Mexico.  The Sevilleta is
		almost 100,000 ha of land that has floristic influences from the Chihuahuan Desert to the south, the Great Plains grassland from the
		east, The Great Basin Desert from the northwest, and montane vegetation as one moves up in elevation.

	* Study Area Description
		
		RIO SALADO - This is a very sandy site.  The predominate grasses are Oryzopsis hymenoides, Hilaria jamesii, and
		Sporobolus flexuosus. The shrubs include four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosus), indigo bush (Dalea
		scoparia), Penstemon ambiguus and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). The herbaceous vegetation includes Cassia bauhinioides, Thelesperma
		megapotamicum, and Zinnia grandiflora.

		DEEP WELL - The deep well site is west of the missile range road, between the road and the deep well meteorological station.
		This is a grassland site with grasses from the shortgrass prairie such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and grasses with a more southern
		affinity such as black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda).  Other grasses found at the site include dropseeds (Sporobolus spp.) and threeawns
		(Aristida spp.).  Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex
		canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.).

		GOAT DRAW - This is a pinyon/juniper site in the Los Pinos mountains.  Transect #1 runs across the rocky hillslopes and
		through two rocky washes.  Transect #2 runs along a gravelly stream bed.  Transect #1 is covered with pinyon (Pinus edulis) and juniper
		(Juniperus monosperma) trees and shrubs that include beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), feather dalea (Dalea formosa), shrub live oak (Quercus
		turbinella), and brown-spined prickly pear (Opuntia phaeacantha). The grasses include hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), bottlebrush
		squirreltail (Sitanion hystrix), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula).  The second transect has shrubs that include cane
		cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and many herbs such as Verbena wrightii, Erodium cicutarium, and
		Lesquerella ovalifolia.

		WATERSHEDS - The transects in this site criss-cross a gravelly ephemeral stream bed in the foothills of the Los Pinos
		Mountains.  The woody vegetation in this stream bed includes Junipers (Juniperus monosperma), Brickellia californica, Apache plume (Fallugia
		paradoxa).  On the hills are Junipers and shrubs such as cane cholla (Opuntia imbricata), beargrass (Nolina microcarpa), and Oreganillo
		(Aloysia wrightii). The herbs in the wash include Lesquerella ovalifolia, and Mirabilis multiflora.  The grasses found at this site
		include three-awn (Aristida sp.), fluff-grass Erioneuron pulchellum, and four species of grama grass (Bouteloua spp.).

Ecoinformatics refers to technologies and practices for gathering, analyzing, visualizing, storing, retrieving and otherwise managing ecological knowledge and information.

Computational Ecology refers to scientific research focused on the quantitative description and analysis of ecological systems using empirical data, mathematical and statistical models, and information technology.

The Lab investigates the structure, function and dynamics of complex networks of organisms interacting with each other and their environment. The study, conservation and management of ecosystems demands an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach as well as the development of new information technology and computational tools, all of which are hallmarks of our research.

The PEaCE Lab's mission is to conduct scientific research, spearhead informatics tool development, and generate, compile and disseminate ecological information in partnership with researchers, universities, research institutes and centers, foundations, NGOs and governmental organizations. 

Our research activities are supported primarily by grants from the National Science Foundation, with additional institution, foundation and corporate support noted within particular research projects. Current NSF grants are administered by the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colorado, whose purpose is to facilitate research and education in field biology.

The online portal for the PEaCE Lab is www.foodwebs.org. This website provides access to information on the people, publications and projects associated with our research. Current Lab projects involve developing information technologies and research applications for analyzing, modeling and visualizing ecological networks with a focus on food webs, or who eats whom among species in ecosystems.

Several perennial life forms, including tree Juniper and Pinus, shrub Larrea and grass Oryzopsis and Sporobolus, are being monitored at 1-3 of four sites which differ in elevation and topography as well as edaphic and annual precipitation characteristics.  The sites represent optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular species and permit specific hypotheses to be tested (e.g., relative impact of wet vs.  dry years on C3 [Oryzopsis] vs. C4 [Sporobolus] grasses).  Demographic measurements are made biannually, after the 'wet' (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons.  For tree and shrub species, estimates of growth and reproduction are basedon branch demography.  Ten replicate branch tips each of 10-20 individuals per species per site are monitored.  For Juniperus, Pinus and Larrea, vegetative growth of branch as well as reproduction are monitored.  Additional measurements include needle length for Pinus and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for Larrea.  For Oryzopsis and Sporobolus, which are both bunch grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction are monitored for 100 individuals per species per site.Demographic data coordinate with physiological measurements to elucidate the physiological bases of changes in growth and reproduction.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Sevilleta Long Term Ecological ResearchDepartment of Biology167 Castetter Hall1 University of New MexicoAlbuquerqueNew Mexico87131-0001USA505-277-5355</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.02789.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-sev.02789.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10236</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Site Location: Five Points is the general area which emcompasses the Black Grama Grassland (known as Five Points Grassland) and Creosote Core (Five Points Larrea) study sites and the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats.

in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e001/e001.html"&gt;E001&lt;/A&gt;, applied at the same time as in that experiment.  For a
description of fertilizer added to E052, see file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  There are four
levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4.

       Level 1: undisturbed
       Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with
the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches
       Level 3: 2 passes or  however many required to produce about
50% bare ground
       Level 4: 3 passes or  however many required to produce 100%
bare ground.  This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in  others.
In  addition,  all woody  vegetation  not destroyed by  tilling is cut at the base.

 Rototilling is applied in late April.

 Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total
of sixteen treatments.  There are four replicates of each of the sixteen
treatments.  In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance;
highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times.
Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design.  Each of the 104
plots is 5m x 5m.

 Measurements taken at E052 will include:  1) species abundances, 2) community
biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground
net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization.  For a list of
treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e052/treatment.html"&gt;trmte52&lt;/A&gt;.

 The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores.
Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a
depth of 50cm.  Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and
poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground.

 In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where
N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were
randomly selected for the competition experiment.  The above and belowground
effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three
competition treatments:  transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1)
with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all
above and belowground parts of neighbors present.  One transplant was grown in
the center of each subplot.  Competition treatments were applied to subplots
within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990.  Competition treatments were
replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four
combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance.  Thus, the 40 plots of
the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance
levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x
3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition
treatment.  A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted.  Competition
treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot.

 In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and
positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were
used:  Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis.
Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2)
no neighbors.  The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient
environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and
the species.  There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments,
one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at
17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2
competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2
environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.  Seedlings were
transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.</dc:description><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:31Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.419052.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.419052.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10238</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LFL&lt;/span&gt; accommodates every entry point of the crop rotation each year and has a factorial design that allows for the comparison of a number of interactions. These interactions include: differences in N management, rotation effects, and cover crops. From 1993 through 2005, the rotation consisted of corn (Zea mays L.)/corn/soybean (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum) vs. continuous corn. During this period, crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) was seeded to 1st yr. corn, 2nd yr corn was in rye grass (Lolium multiflorum), soybean had no cover, and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) was frost-seeded into wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, under the direction of Dr. Sieglinde Snapp and through consultation with a farmer advisory group, the rotation was shortened to a 3 yr rotation of corn/soybean/wheat vs. continuous corn. The remaining plot in each management system was converted to a 2 yr rotation of corn/soybean. Cereal rye (Secale cereale) is now planted after corn regardless of crop rotation. Cereal rye follows soybean in the 2-yr rotation. Red clover is frost-seeded into wheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management systems are: Conventional, Integrated Fertilizer and Integrated Compost. Weed management is identical across systems, and nitrogen fertilizer management adjusted to take into account soil N availability and balance nitrogen inputs across treatments. The cover crop is present as a split plot (plus minus) within each system. The split-plot cover crop treatment was established in 1993 in Integrated Fertilizer and in Integrated Compost, while the split-plot cover crop treatment was established 14 years later in 2007 in the Conventional treatment, to allow a comparison of short and long-term cover crop presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the organic management system was changed to a comparison of a perennial grain systems (perennial wheat-alfalfa intercrop) and a 4-yr rotation of corn/soybean/wheat/ alfalfa (Medicago sativa). This allows the comparison of a typical Michigan field crop organic system to a novel system that involves a new, perennial system.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:contributor>RichardHarwood</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>SieglindeSnapp</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-kbs.1.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-kbs.1.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10241</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>1988-01-01 to 2004-01-01</dc:coverage></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Their keystone status is attributed primarily to the effects of their burrowing and foraging behavior, but they differ ecologically in several important respects.  We studied the comparative functional roles of these species  where they co-occur at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, focusing on their impacts on grassland vegetation.   We found that vegetation cover, structure, and species richness varied across a gradient extending out from the mound centers, and these patterns differed between prairie dog and kangaroo rat mounds.  Certain species and functional groups  of plants associated differentially with mounds and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo  rats.  Where both species co-occurred locally there was greater soil disturbance, more organic material from their feces, and higher activity of other animals.  The overall effect of these rodents was to create a mosaic of different patches across the landscape such that their combined activities increased andscape heterogeneity and plant species richness.  Our results demonstrate complementary effects of two co-occurring keystone species on their associated biotic communities.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Sevilleta Long Term Ecological ResearchDepartment of Biology167 Castetter Hall1 University of New MexicoAlbuquerqueNew Mexico87131-0001USA505-277-5355</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:18:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.193.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-sev.193.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10242</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Study Area Name:  Pino Gate

Sampling is done at least one week after rainfalls greater than one inch, or equivalent snowmelt, and thus do not represent ephemeral discharge peaks. The following chemical variables are measured on filtered water (0.45 micron) unless noted: Ca, Mg, Na, K, nitrate, total alkalinity (unfiltered water), chloride, sulfate, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus (PO4-P), total dissolved phosphorus (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TDP&lt;/span&gt;), dissolved organic carbon (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOC&lt;/span&gt;), dissolved Si, and specific conductance.  Beginning in August 2006 dissolved Ca, Mg, Na and K were measured by ion chromatography instead of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The pH is measured in the field (streams). Additional field measurements include water temperature and dissolved oxygen as percent and mg/l, and additional lab measurements include total suspended solids and total phosphorus (TP).  Stream discharge is measured at a nearby site on Augusta Creek by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USGS&lt;/span&gt;. Several other local stream sites are also sampled in this way; contact Dr. Hamilton for details.&lt;/p&gt;

in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e001/e001.html"&gt;E001&lt;/A&gt;, applied at the same time as in that experiment.  For a
description of fertilizer added to E052, see file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  There are four
levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4.

       Level 1: undisturbed
       Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with
the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches
       Level 3: 2 passes or  however many required to produce about
50% bare ground
       Level 4: 3 passes or  however many required to produce 100%
bare ground.  This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in  others.
In  addition,  all woody  vegetation  not destroyed by  tilling is cut at the base.

 Rototilling is applied in late April.

 Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total
of sixteen treatments.  There are four replicates of each of the sixteen
treatments.  In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance;
highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times.
Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design.  Each of the 104
plots is 5m x 5m.

 Measurements taken at E052 will include:  1) species abundances, 2) community
biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground
net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization.  For a list of
treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e052/treatment.html"&gt;trmte52&lt;/A&gt;.

 The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores.
Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a
depth of 50cm.  Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and
poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground.

 In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where
N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were
randomly selected for the competition experiment.  The above and belowground
effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three
competition treatments:  transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1)
with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all
above and belowground parts of neighbors present.  One transplant was grown in
the center of each subplot.  Competition treatments were applied to subplots
within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990.  Competition treatments were
replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four
combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance.  Thus, the 40 plots of
the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance
levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x
3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition
treatment.  A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted.  Competition
treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot.

 In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and
positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were
used:  Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis.
Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2)
no neighbors.  The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient
environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and
the species.  There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments,
one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at
17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2
competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2
environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.  Seedlings were
transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.</dc:description><dc:date>1992</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:19:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:19:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.429052.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.429052.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10264</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

It exists especially in areas of little tidal inundation and low salinities. As such, it may play an important role in the accretion of marshes where sediment sources are not readily accessible. Biogenic accretion of marshes is a slow process representing the net result of production and decomposition. To study the process effectively requires long-term observations and experiments. We will initiate research at this site by selecting locations for study, collecting preliminary data on the locations, and designing long-term experiments. Plots for long-term observations will allow for analyses of changes in dominance of cover by plant species. We will choose plots to include the interface between J. roemerianus and other species and will follow changes at the interface.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research ProjectDepartment of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, 291 McCormick Road, PO Box 400123CharlottesvilleVA22904-4123USA434-924-7761434-982-2137http://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1998-08-01</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:19:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:19:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-vcr.122.7/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-vcr.122.7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10275</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Upper Phillips Creek - core - Upper Phillips Creek - core</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-75.8325 W
