Estimates of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and consequently, total net primary productivity (NPP), are more difficult. We addressed one of the three main objectives of the Global Primary Productivity Data Initiative for grassland systems - to develop simple models or algorithms to estimate missing components of total system NPP. Any estimate of BNPP requires an accounting of total root biomass, the percentage of living biomass, and annual turnover of live roots. We derived a relationship using aboveground peak biomass and mean annual temperature as predictors of belowground biomass (r2 = 0.54; P=0.01). The percentage of live material was 0.6, based on published values. We used three different functions to describe root turnover: constant, a direct function of aboveground biomass, or as a positive exponential relationship with mean annual temperature. We tested the various models against a large database of global grassland NPP and the constant turnover and direct function models were approximately equally descriptive (r2 =0.31 and 0.37), while the exponential function had a stronger correlation with the measured values (r2=0.40) and had a better fit than the other two models at the productive end of the BNPP gradient. When applied to extensive data we assembled from two grassland sites with reliable estimates of total NPP, the direct function was most effective, especially at lower productivity sites. We provide some caveats for its use in systems that lie at the extremes of the grassland gradient and stress that there are large uncertainties associated with measured and modeled estimates of BNPP.</dc:description><dc:contributor>R.

Nevertheless, this study has provided a basis for evaluating the quality and utility of the data generated by past studies and of the NPP estimates that have been reported in the literature for tropical forests. Clearly, the most important knowledge gap is with respect to the belowground components of NPP in these ecosystems. In particular, fine root losses are likely to be a substantial proportion of NPP in many tropical forests, and they as yet remain unquantified. It is also clear that there have been many of the previous NPP studies in this biome have involved methodological problems and poor documentation. Henceforward, it is paramount that such studies be carefully designed and reported so as to avoid these pitfalls. A third issue that needs to be addressed is that of sampling bias and the lack of replication in either time or space for NPP studies in these forests. Given the very small and subjectively located plots that are the basis for most of the existing data, it is possible that the existing understanding of NPP processes in tropical forests is highly skewed toward the highest biomass patches (flat sites with large trees, no gaps) and is unrepresentative of the larger forest landscapes.</dc:description><dc:contributor>S.Brown</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>D.

produce them are critical to the functioning of the Earth's life-support system. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly, and therefore represent part of the total economic value of the planet. We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US$16-54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US$18 trillion per year. Because ecosystem services are not fully 'captured' in commercial markets or adequately quantified in terms comparable with economic services and manufactured capital, they are often given too little weight in policy decisions. This neglect may ultimately compromise the sustainability of humans in the biosphere. The economies of the Earth would grind to a halt without the services of ecological life- support systems, so in one sense their total value to the economy is infinite. However, it can be instructive to estimate the 'incremental' or 'marginal' value of ecosystem services (the estimated rate of change of value compared with changes in ecosystem services from their current levels). There have been many studies in the past few decades aimed at estimating the value of a wide variety of ecosystem services. We have gathered together this large (but scattered) amount of information and present it here in a form useful for ecologists, economists, policy makers and the general public. From this synthesis, we have estimated values for ecosystem services per unit area by biome, and then multiplied by the total area of each biome and summed over all services and biomes.</dc:description><dc:contributor>StephenFarber</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.183.13/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.183.13</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9943</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Various locations worldwide.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180 W

The magnitudes and inter-annual variations in NPP of croplands in the US Mid-West were estimated using crop area and yield data from the US National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Total NPP, including estimates of both above and below-ground components, was calculated from harvested yield data by (1) conversion from reporting units of yield of the crop product, usually in volume, to mass; (2) conversion from fresh weight to dry weight; (3) estimation of above-ground yield using crop harvest indices, defined as the ratio of economic product (e.g. grain) dry weight to plant above-ground dry weight; and (4) estimation of below-ground yield as a function of above-ground biomass. This approach was applied to corn, soybean, sorghum, sunflower, oats, barley, wheat and hay in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio and Wisconsin for 1992, and in Iowa from 1982 to 1996. Many counties in these eight states had over 70 per cent coverage of these crops. In Iowa, corn and soybean accounted for over 50 per cent of the land area in most counties. County-level NPP in 1992 ranged from 4 Mg/ha/yr (400 g/m2/yr, dry biomass, or 200 gC/m2/yr in terms of carbon content) in North Dakota, Wisconsin and Minnesota, to over 17 Mg/ha/yr (1700 g/m2/yr, dry biomass, or 850 gC/m2/yr) in central Iowa, Illinois and Ohio. Areas of highest NPP were dominated by corn and soybean cultivation. NPP for counties in Iowa varied between years by a factor of 2, with the lowest NPP in 1983 which had an unusually wet Spring, in 1988 which was a drought year, and in 1993 which experienced floods. A sensitivity analysis, conducted by varying harvest index and root:shoot ratio by 10-50 per cent, indicated that the limit of accuracy of the method is about 1 Mg/ha/yr (100 g/m2/yr, dry biomass).</dc:description><dc:contributor>J.Haskett</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MarcSteininger</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>H.Strand</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>R.Wright</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:29Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.184.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.184.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9945</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>U.S. Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied.

Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species.

The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter, Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin.</dc:description><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.5697120.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.5697120.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9950</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

The change in the number, type, and amount of plant and grazing animal species is monitored in more than 20 fields. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields. Abandoned fields included in E014 are 4, 5, 10, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 47, 53, 70, 72, 76, 77. Fields 22(B), 29(A), and 69(C) were originally included in E014 but used for other purposes shortly after the start of the study. This experiment was established in 1983 and 1989 by principal investigators Johannes Knops and David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:08:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.559514.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.559514.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9957</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

The actions of any animals in this region that concentrate organic matter in patches, or contribute to the movement of organic matter underground (such as termites or ants) must influence the local distribution of moisture and plant nutrients in the soil. In the southern Karoo, harvester ants Messor capensis add seed husks and soil to their nest-mounds in layers. Each layer probably represents a brief burst of underground activity following rain, when soil is placed on the mound. This is followed by a longer period of dumping of seed husks and plant matter on the mound. Although some of the plant matter is removed by wind, enough remains to increase the organic content of the soils on the edges of harvester ant nest-mounds.

The compilation was used to examine dynamics of 14 nutrients, including translocation properties of roots of varying size and status.

Fine roots are an important source and sink for nutrients in terrestrial biogeochemistry. The data collected come from 56 published studies that give information on fine root (less than 5-mm diameter) nutrient concentrations, root diameters, and retranslocation of nutrients. These studies include diverse vegetation and biomes, including grass, shrub, and tree functional types from temperate, tropical, boreal and tundra systems. The preponderance of data comes from experiments with temperate and coniferous trees. Study sites were a mixture of natural and manipulated ecosystems, including old growth, secondary growth, old fields, and tundra systems. Data from fertilized, potted or greenhouse experiments were excluded. Data are available by diameter class. This listing builds on the database of Jackson et al (1996, 1997). Please see Gordon and Jackson (2000) for more information.

The following hypotheses were examined (Gordon and Jackson 2000) for fine root nutrients by analyzing these data: (1) that there is an inverse relationship of fine root nutrient concentrations with root diameter, and (2) that retranslocation of nutrients out of fine roots is minimal. Nutrient concentrations of roots less than or equal to 5 mm in diameter were analyzed as a function of root diameter and root status (live, dead, and undifferentiated), including a comparison for coniferous and broad-leaved trees. From the results, mean N concentrations in live and dead fine roots were identical and may imply little retranslocation of root N with senescence, but conflicting evidence from C:N ratios highlights the need for further research (Gordon and Jackson 2000). These results have practical implications for various ecological methods and for the representation of roots in biogeochemical models.

A PDF copy of the Gordon and Jackson (2000) paper is available at http://www.biology.duke.edu/jackson/Ecol99.htm. 

This data set builds on the initial root data compiled by R. B. Jackson in the mid-1990s (see Jackson et al. 1996; Jackson et al. 1997). The expanded and updated data set (Gordon and Jackson 2000) contains nutrient concentrations for approximately 372 site-pit-depths from 56 papers. In addition, the initial Jackson data set has been expanded for studies with root turnover rates (data for 341 site-vegetation combinations for approximately 188 sites from 152 papers in Gill and Jackson (2000) and rooting depth (data for approximately 298 sites with 565 profiles in Schenk and Jackson 2002). The three recent papers include most of the data contained in the initial root data set; however, some observations may have been excluded because of more stringent selection criteria. Many of the source papers provided data for the three recent rooting papers and users are encouraged to review all three data sets.

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC) for Biogeochemistry Dynamics organized and formatted these data for long-term archive. The data and companion references were downloaded in html format from http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E081/002/default.htm. The HTML data file was converted to a tab-delimited text file with most all cells filled. Information and data that were not available in the source paper are represented as "N/A" or -999 for numeric columns. Cells containing "ND" indicate that the nutrient was not detected. An asterisk (*) in the Flag column indicates that some of the nutrient values were calculated from data presented in the respective paper.</dc:description><dc:contributor>W.

Variables used to characterize belowground vegetation structure include the depth above which 50 percent of all roots are located and the depth above which 95 percent of all roots are located in the profile. For each root profile, information recorded includes latitude and longitude, elevation, soil texture, depth of organic horizons, type of roots measured (e.g., fine or total, live or dead), sampling methods, units of measurements (root mass, length, number, surface area), and sampling depth. Some profiles lack information on one or more of these variables. Also recorded are presence and dominance of plant life forms (including succulents, forbs, grasses, semi-shrubs, shrubs, and four categories of trees: needle-leaved vs. broadleaved, evergreen vs. deciduous) and whether the vegetation was relatively natural or altered by humans (e.g., forest plantations and pastures). The database also includes data on mean annual precipitation and the seasonal distribution of precipitation.

Data sets that are related to this root profile data set include root nutrient concentrations (for approximately 372 site-pit-depths from 56 papers in Gordon and Jackson 2000) and root turnover rates (data for approximately 188 sites from 152 papers that were used to estimate root turnover rates for 341 site-vegetation combinations in Gill and Jackson 2000). The three recent papers include most of the data contained in the initial root data set; however, some observations may have been excluded because of more stringent selection criteria.

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for Biogeochemistry Dynamics organized and formatted these data for long-term archive. The archived data are contained in two files: (1) The ecosystem root profiles file, containing estimated 50 percent rooting depths (D50) and 95 percent rooting depths (D95) plus information on sampling methods, vegetation, climate, and soil, and (2) a file containing the references to file (1). These files were obtained from H. Jochen Schenk, Department of Biological Science, California State University Fullerton, California, in February 2003. The data were placed into a spreadsheet format and stored as an ASCII comma-separated (.csv) file. Missing values are represented by -999.</dc:description><dc:contributor>H.

Sampling was stratified by types of substrate, with the number of cores in each subsample proportional to the surface area of its stratum. 
One of the aims of the sampling was to study the spatial distribution of the oribatid community in the mosses, and to verify whether this structure could be related to that of environmental variables.. Within the sampling area, mosses have not been disturbed during recent years, so we considered their spatial pattern to be natural.

We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family, and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today?  Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent, and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?).  These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body size in ecology and paleoecology:  linking pattern and process across space, time and taxonomic scales).  We began with the updated version of Wilson and Reeder's (1993) taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N = 4629 species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values.  The sources are line referenced in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata.  Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on.  Please note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations.  Although we relied heavily a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N = 905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N = 688), and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N = 505), these total less than half the records in the current database.  The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources (see reference table).  Furthermore, we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, North and South America, and Australia (an additional 230 species). "Late Pleistocene" is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Overall, the temporal coverage is from the late Pleistocene to present (ca. 45,000 ybp to present). Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged across gender and geographic space.  Consequently, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important.  All extant orders of mammals are included, as well as several archaic groups (N = 4859 species).  Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), there are 5731 entries.  We have body masses for the following:  Artiodactyla (280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea (75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera (3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea (5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna (2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (1 record), Monotremata (7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata (5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota (8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), and Xenarthra (75 records).  

Data has undergone substantial data quality and assurance checking, though this is an on-going process.  Histograms of the body masses of each order were produced, and values at the tails were double-checked for accuracy.  When multiple sources of information were available for a species, or new sources encountered, we used those with higher sample sizes and gender-specific information.

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1990</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:09:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:09:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.888801.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.888801.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9982</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.
