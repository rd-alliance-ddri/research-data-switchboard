This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070).  The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger.  The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added.  Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%.  The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations.

	Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \and K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June.  For further information, see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd3.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots.  Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70&lt;! (see E070)&gt;.

	Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture.  Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen.  At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals.

	The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species:  Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC).  Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989.  The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place.

	A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area.  The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource.  Light readings were taken above and below vegetation.  Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken.  A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:59:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:59:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.8899055.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.8899055.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9688</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Most of the prairies had developed after being abandoned from agriculture, but none of the savannahs had been cultivated. The history of burning varied between sites. Insects were sampled via sweep-net sampling, pitfalls and ant plates throughout the growing season in each of 49 grassland fields and savannahs. In total, 89,596 individuals of 1,167 species were captured and enumerated. Body size was measured for a subset of grasshoppers collected.

 E004 that were used in E060.  Pairs of 9 m x 9 m plots
were demarcated.  One
plot in each pair was randomly assigned to exclude birds (BEX) and the other
to allow birds to forage for grasshoppers in the vegetation (BAL).  A frame
was built around BEX plots with wooden posts at each corner and heavy aluminum
wire stretched between posts 1m above the ground.  Bird netting (2.5 cm mesh)
was then stretched over this framework and attached to the ground with
numerous wire stakes. In 1989, these plots were set up 15 July, but were set
up 15 May in 1990 to examine the effects of predation in the early summer.
Between 15-25 August, netting was removed and grasshoppers were sampled within
both BEX and BAL plots and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification to
species or genus, counting and weighing. Grasshoppers were sampled by two
people with butterfly nets. After the grasshoppers were sampled, the
vegetation was sampled. Within each 9 m x 9 m plot, three 0.1 m x 3 m strips
were clipped, sorted to species, dried and weighed.  In 1990, the exclosures
were set up 15 May, but all vegetation and grasshopper sampling was similar to
that in 1989.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1997</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:00:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:00:35Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.100959501.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.100959501.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9724</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.

Each mixture differed in plot elevation, soil water content, and soil salinity, so each was considered a separate habitat. The mixtures also occurred in different geographic locations (i.e. Dean Creek on southern Sapelo Island, Marsh Landing on southwestern Sapelo Island, and Shell Hammock, which is near the University of Georgia Marine Institute). In May 1996, 16 1mx1m plots were placed within each plant mixture and alternate plots were assigned to control and fertilization treatments. Pelletized fertilizer (29% N, 3% P, 4% K) was broadcast into fertilization treatment plots by hand at the rate of 60g/m^2 every 2 weeks. The central 0.5mx0.5m of each plot was harvested in September 1997 after two summers growth. Live plants were sorted to species, dried to a constant mass, and weighed to measure biomass. Standing dead shoots and litter were not weighed.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>WadeSheldon</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:01:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:01:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.190.13/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.190.13</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9746</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set PLT-GCED-0409, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data.

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island.

Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-81.493498 W

Crab abundance was determined by counting the number of crab holes within a 625 cm^2 quadrat and converting the counts to number per square meter.  Counts were made in the mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 per zone) at all sites.  This method does not differentiate which species made a particular hole and therefore only estimates total crab abundance.  Plugged holes were excluded from the counts.  Mean density across all sites and zones was 250 m^-2 (+/- 285 s.d.).</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KennethHelm</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MonicaWatkins</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:02:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:02:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.181.22/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.181.22</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9776</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-0401, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
