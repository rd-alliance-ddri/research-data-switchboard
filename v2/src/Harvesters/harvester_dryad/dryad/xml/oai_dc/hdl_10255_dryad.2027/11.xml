(1995) developed a model representing the change that occurs in ecosystem state (or habitat type) along the shorezone, from the forest -&gt; high marsh -&gt; low marsh -&gt; mud flat, in response to the increased inundation caused by rising sea-level. They suggested that a seaward shift in ecosystem state is largely dependent on local slope and sediment supply. The states are associated with the dominant vegetation found within each. The most seaward (lowest in elevation) state is the mud flat. It is frequently inundated by tide and typically supports algal species. The next landward state is the mineral low marsh; it is dominated by Spartina alterniflora and is typically flooded at high tide. Sediments here may be largely mineral in origin. The next landward state is the high marsh; it may be dominated by S. patens, Distichlis spicata, and Juncus roemerianus. It is occasionally inundated by high tides and the soil is usually organic. The transition zone between the high marsh and the forest is typically dominated by Iva frutescens, Baccharis hamifolia, and Juniperus virginiana. It is only inundated during severe storm surges. The forest may be dominated by either pines or hardwoods and is again flooded with sea water only by storm surges. Goals: The goal of this long-term project is to evaluate how sea-level rise affects marsh evolution and ecosystem state change. Seventeen sites along Virginia's eastern shore have been selected to study marsh evolution on both the mainland and the barrier islands. These sites will be available for long-term seasonal to annual observations. Some sites will also be available for experimentation and short-term studies. The initial project is to establish initial site characteristics.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research ProjectDepartment of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, 291 McCormick Road, PO Box 400123CharlottesvilleVA22904-4123USA434-924-7761434-982-2137http://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-vcr.167.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-vcr.167.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10387</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Box Tree, Small creek that leads into Holt Creek - Box Tree, Small creek that leads into Holt Creek</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Brownsville Marsh, Eastern Shore - Brownsville Marsh, Eastern Shore</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Boxtree Marsh - Boxtree Marsh</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Eastern Shore - Eastern Shore</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GATR Tract (approximate location) - GATR Tract (approximate location)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Greens Creek - Greens Creek</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Hog Island, VA - Hog Island, VA</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>North Hog Island (chronosequence) - North Hog Island (chronosequence)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Indian Town marsh - Indian Town marsh</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mill Creek - Mill Creek</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Oyster Harbor - Oyster Harbor</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Woodland Farms marsh - Woodland Farms marsh</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-75.87573598920 W

For this comprehensive database, we systematically gathered data from the literature that experimentally manipulated (1) nutrients through fertilization, (2) herbivore pressure through exclusion, enclosion, or removal experiments, (3) predators through similar means, or (4) a combination of these treatment combinations. Special priority was given to studies that factorially manipulated multiple nutrients (especially N &amp; P) or manipulated both nutrients and herbivores (bottom-up and top-down), and which measured species richness, biomass or nutrient content of autotrophic responses at the community level. In addition, the Trophic Cascades database (owned by E. Borer et al.) has been folded into this framework, as well as data from several other published analyses from restricted systems (e.g., H. Hillebrand periphyton database). The goals were manifold; however, the central objective was to compare with meta-analyses the relative effects of these experimental manipulations across global organismal functional groups and ecosystem types. To this end, the database was designed to be general and flexible in order to accomodate varying research questions, methodologies, spatial and temporal scales, and abiotic and biotic covariates reported across different studies. As of this writing (14 November 2006), the database contains nearly 2000 studies across terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems, and well over 10,000 treatment responses. Data are entered into four different tables in a relational design (study-level data, treatment/responses, local biotic covariates of response and manipulated taxa, &amp; general/global taxonomic and functional characteristics of these taxa).</dc:description><dc:contributor>EricSeabloom</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JenniferSmith</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JackieNgai</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MattBracken</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>StanHarpole</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ElsaCleland</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JamesElser</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HelmutHillebrand</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ElizabethBorer</dc:contributor><dc:date>2006-11-02</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:24:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:24:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.301.7/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.301.7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10396</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>global</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180.0000 W

Here, I evaluated the relative contributions of selection from a gape-limited predator (Ambystoma opacum) and spatial location within a larger landscape to explanations of variation in foraging, growth, and survival in 10 populations of temporary pond breeding salamander larvae (Ambystoma maculatum).  In parameterized models, high gape-limited predation risk was predicted to select for intense foraging and rapid growth in larvae when migration rates were low (less than 5%).  Under common garden conditions, salamander larvae from populations naturally exposed to constant predation risk from A. opacum foraged more actively than those from populations faced with lower predation risks.  Higher foraging rates were associated with lower survival in populations exposed to free-ranging A. opacum predators.  These results demonstrate for the first time that prey hunger can evolve in a natural landscape of variable gape-limited predation risk depending on natural selection for growth into a size refuge.  Moreover, evidence suggests that foraging-predation risk tradeoffs can evolve over microgeographic scales.  However, foraging rates also appear to have been affected by gene flow: prey individuals from populations with high predation risk foraged more actively if located within regions with similar predation threats.  This interaction between local selection and spatial location suggests a joint role for adaptation and maladaptation in shaping species interactions across natural landscapes, a finding with implications for dynamics at the population, community, and metacommunity levels.</dc:description><dc:date>2007-03-09</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:24:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:24:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.306.6/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.306.6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10402</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Totoket Ridge, Northford, CT</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-72.1333 W

The second EMDI workshop was held in April 2001 at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A. EMDI is supported by GAIM (Global Analysis, Integration and Modelling), a component of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The goals of EMDI are to compare model estimates of terrestrial carbon fluxes (NPP) to estimates from ground-based measurements, and to improve understanding of environmental controls of carbon allocation. The primary questions to be addressed are to test simulated controls and model formulation on the water, carbon, and nutrient budgets with the observed NPP data providing the constraint for autotrophic fluxes and the integrity of scaled biophysical driving variables. EMDI - the NPP data from the NPP project forms the core data that was that was used in the EMDI Workshops (funded by GAIM and NCEAS). The workshop has resulted in a more NPP and model driver data being submitted to ORNL; in addition, the workshops provided a review of the data. NCEAS provided 6 months of time support for an intern at ORNL (Keri Johnson) to prepare data for the EMDI workshops.</dc:description><dc:contributor>J. M.

Infaunal and epifaunal molluscs were hand-collected from within quadrats of known area from mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved in ethanol, measured and counted (count data is reported separately). Length of each measurable individual was determined using calipers or an ocular micrometer mounted in a stereomicroscope.  Species abundance and density data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-1010a1. Numbers of individuals of each species in the abundance data file may not correspond exactly to the numbers of individuals in the size data file because some individuals may not have been measureable.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>StevenPennings</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielSaucedo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>NickScoville</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>KristenAnstead</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:25:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:25:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.330.11/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.330.11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10421</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-1010a2, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.  Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-81.493498 W

traits, successional status, and resource reduction for five grass species
that were grown for three years in monoculture in replicated field plots on
soils prepared to have different availabilities of nitrogen.  It also
determines the results of competition experiments among various combinations
of these species as well as the differing feedback effects of each species on
soil nitrogen mineralization rates.  All of this work has motivated the desire
to more fully understand the mechanisms of interactions among plants and their
resources, in the belief that this might eventually allow predictions of the
dynamics, diversity, and composition of plant communities.</dc:description><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:25:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:25:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.648926.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.648926.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10434</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data.

measure how adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:25:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:25:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.7998001.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.7998001.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10437</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:26:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:26:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.648901.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.648901.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10456</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

growth and establishment of woody vegetation in old fields. This experiment is
located in fields A and B.  There are 6 plots in each field.  Each plot is 10
by 30 meters, with the long axis perpendicular to the field/woods margin.
Plots within a field are spaced at least 5 meters apart.  Approximately 5
meters of the 30 meters length extends into the woods, the remaining 25 meters
extend out into the field.  Each plot is divided into twelve, 5 by 5 meter
sections.  Six quadrats were placed within each exclosure in each 5 meters of
length.  Plots are located randomly within each of those blocks.  To assign
locations randomly a grid was set up from 0 - 4 along the length and 0 - 9
along the width of each plot and random numbers were drawn in pairs, one from
each of the random distributions.  The plots were marked with rebar.  Three
plots in each field are fenced with poultry netting, approximately  2 meters
high, to exclude deer.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.</dc:description><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:26:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:26:43Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.648902.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.648902.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10462</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
