The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached. Rain event samples are collected, treated, and analyzed as all other water quality samples.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Florida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramFlorida International University University Park OE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-6054fcelter@fiu.edu  http://fcelter.fiu.edu</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>TimGrahl</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielChilders</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DavidIwaniec</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DamonRondeau</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>GustavoRubio</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>GregLosada</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>EmilieVerdon</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>SarahRidgway</dc:contributor><dc:date>2005-02-14</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:55:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:55:45Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-knb-lter-fce.0008.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-knb-lter-fce.0008.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9588</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Data were collected in the Shark River Slough, within Everglades National Park, South Florida</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Study Area: South Florida, Everglades National Park, and Florida Bay</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached.

The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached. Rain event samples are collected, treated, and analyzed as all other water quality samples.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Florida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramFlorida International University University Park OE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-6054fcelter@fiu.edu  http://fcelter.fiu.edu</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>TimGrahl</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielChilders</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DavidIwaniec</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DamonRondeau</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>GustavoRubio</dc:contributor><dc:date>2002-08-27</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:55:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:55:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-knb-lter-fce.0005.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-knb-lter-fce.0005.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9595</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Data were collected in the Shark River Slough, within Everglades National Park, South Florida</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Study Area: South Florida, Everglades National Park, and Florida Bay</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these monthly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with an YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached.

The effects of enrichment in the treatment stream (Watershed 54, WS54) were compared to conditions in the reference stream (Watershed 53, WS53) and one year of comprehensive baseline sampling was conducted in both streams prior to enrichment. Our first objective was to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment on growth and production of organisms. Our second objective was to determine the effects of nutrients on the fate of carbon resources, which were altered via increased microbial metabolism and invertebrate consumption. Most data were analyzed using Randomized Intervention Analysis (RIA)(Carpenter et al. 1989), which was based on pre-treatment differences between the two streams to differences following nutrient addition. This study was the first to determine the long-term effects of nutrient enrichment in a system in which organisms derive most of their carbon from detritus or detritus-based prey. Nutrient addition profoundly affected the treatment stream, with effects propagating from microbes to ecosystem-level effects. Below are specific results. EFFECTS ON ORGANISMS Nutrient addition resulted in an increase in microbial biomass and production. We observed dramatic increases in leaf-associated fungal production and biomass and significant effects of nutrient addition on leaf-associated bacterial production, but not on bacterial biomass. Whereas production of fungi exhibited an overall average 211% increase in response to nutrient addition in year 2 of enrichment, bacterial production only increased by 60% compared to the control stream. The mean number of fungal species detected per sample date before enrichment and in the reference stream was 12-13 but this increased to 18.5 species during enrichment. Primary producers showed some response to nutrient addition, despite light limitation. Contrary to our predictions, we observed a significant increase in algal biomass as measured by chlorophyll a, but the response was largely limited to high light months. There was a significant effect of enrichment on biofilm AFDM, but without the seasonal effect seen with chlorophyll a. There was no significant effect on cell densities of algae. There has been no apparent change in algal community composition as a result of enrichment. Production and biomass of invertebrates increased in response to nutrient addition. There has been a significant effect of enrichment on invertebrate biomass measured monthly and invertebrate production in the treatment stream was 153% higher compared to trends in the control stream after 1 year. Leaf litter standing crop in the stream is declining. Long-term data indicate a significant regression between benthic leaf litter standing crop and invertebrate production. Data from yr. 1 indicate a much higher production in the nutrient addition stream than would be predicted from leaf litter standing crop. Our longer term predictions for invertebrate biomass in the treatment stream include a decline in production compared to the response we observed after 1 yr of enrichment, based on the decline in benthic leaf litter. Growth rates of invertebrates were enhanced by nutrient addition. We measured increased growth rates of invertebrates with short aquatic life cycles, but did not observe increased growth rates on invertebrates with longer life cycles. Chironomidae, the dominant collector/gatherers, grew ca. 30% faster in the enriched stream than in the reference stream among all size classes. Tallaperla maria, a long-lived leaf-eating stonefly, did not respond to enrichment in terms of daily growth rates. We have data on the C, N, and P content of consumers showing that some taxa have much lower body P content than others (i.e., Tallaperla maria 0.5%, Chironomidae . 1.1%). Lower body P content generally suggests a lower P requirement for growth. Thus, Tallaperla maria, and other taxa with lower body P, may not be nutrient limited. Rates of organic matter breakdown were accelerated by nutrient addition. We observed increased breakdown of rhododendron and red maple leaves as well as wood. Rates of leaf decay exhibited a ca. 70% increase in the treatment stream relative to the control after 1 year of enrichment, and a ca. 200% increase in the 2nd year of enrichment. Breakdown rates with nutrient enrichment for both leaf types were outside of the 99% confidence interval of long-term means. Rates of decay of wood veneers exhibited 477 and 795% increases in the treatment stream relative to the control after 1 and 2 years of enrichment, respectively. Organic matter standing crop and export were affected by nutrient addition. We have observed dramatic reductions in leaf litter standing crop in the treatment stream, as well as increased export of fine particulate organic matter (significant effect on seston yield via RIA). There was no effect of nutrient addition on dissolved organic carbon. Whole-stream metabolism was affected by nutrient addition. Measurements of whole-stream gross primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (R) were highly variable seasonally. Contrary to our prediction that there would be a greater response in R than in GPP, effects on GPP were greater than on R. This result, however, was based on a very strong positive response of GPP to nutrient addition in April when GPP rates were highest, particularly in yr 2, and less response of GPP at other times of the year. The positive effect of nutrient addition on R was more consistent throughout the year. Food quality of detritus, as measured by C:N and C:P increased with nutrient enrichment. We have found that P content of leaf litter is much higher in the enriched stream than in the reference stream (i.e., lower C:P and higher %P). We have not seen any remarkable changes in %N or C:N of leaf litter in the enriched stream, suggesting that microbes demand P more than N. Respiration on detrital resources increased in response to nutrient addition. Yes, we observed increased respiration on both leaves (50-70% stimulation) and wood (300-350% stimulation) in response to nutrient addition.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:56:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:56:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3062.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3062.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9623</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>WS53, WS54</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Entrenchment is a morphological condition which results from disequilibrium in aquatic systems due to the disconnection of a channel and its adjacent floodplain. In the southeastern Piedmont, this is most typically due to land use practices that eroded historic sediment from the hillslopes and caused the channel to aggrade. As the stream incised through this deposited sediment, it became entrenched. These types of streams, although prevalent throughout the Southeast and the focus for widespread restoration efforts, have not been quantitatively studied. This study focuses on the dynamics of entrenched stream reaches and how they respond during baseflow and flood conditions in relation to channel morphology, streambed composition, and sediment transport. A significant difference between entrenched and non-entrenched reaches is anticipated for width/depth, velocity, sediment particle size, and habitat characteristics. Modeling with HEC-RAS is proposed to show significant differences in the magnitude of entrenchment, overbank recurrence interval, bed shear stress, flow velocities, stream power, and tractive force between reach types. Findings from this study may affect how entrenched reaches are restored in the future.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:56:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:56:55Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3061.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3061.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9624</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Shope Fork upstream of bridge and in field downstream of new parking lot.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Stream enrichment increases leaf decomposition rates, alters benthic invertebrate community structure, and increases invertebrate secondary production (Cross 2004; Greenwood 2004). However, stream systems are linked to their surrounding terrestrial system via aquatic insect emergence; an aquatic subsidy of terrestrial food webs (Jackson and Fisher 1986; Sanzone et. al. 2003) and a possible pathway for changes in aquatic systems to impact terrestrial systems. Because resource subsidies typically flow down a productivity gradient, an increase in the productivity of a donor system may increase this resource subsidy and alter the food web dynamics of the recipient system (e.g., Sanzone 2001, Polis et. al. 1997). Since July 2000, we have been continuously enriching a first order headwater stream and have facilitated increased aquatic invertebrate production (Cross 2004), which may increase the aquatic insect subsidy to the terrestrial system. Therefore, changes in food web dynamics caused by nutrient enrichment may not be limited to aquatic systems, but may also cascade through the terrestrial system with unknown effects. To better understand how aquatic and terrestrial systems are linked, I will test whether stream nutrient enrichment increases aquatic subsidies to terrestrial systems. Using a 15N stable isotope tracer I will test three predictions. Prediction 1: Aquatic insect emergence subsidizes near-stream terrestrial spiders more than upland spiders. Prediction 2: Aquatic insect subsidies increase spider abundance, richness, and biomass near streams when compared to upland habitats. Prediction 3: Stream nutrient enrichment increases this aquatic subsidy.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:56:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:56:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3064.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3064.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9626</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>WS53, WS54</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

The REP is tasked to identify and characterize fractured rock aquifers within various hydrogeologic settings in the Piedmont and mountains of N.C. Planners, scientists, educators, and the public are using the REP findings to understand, develop and protect Western NC�s ground water supplies. This work would utilize historic data collected in the Coweeta watershed (stream gage, soils, precipitation, and surface water quality data, geologic mapping, and others) and would compliment the research being conducted as part of the Long Term Ecological Project at Coweeta. One of the goals of the REP is to develop an understanding of the ground water occurrence, quality, and movement within the major rock types that comprise the Piedmont and mountains of NC. The Coweeta basin represents a rock type that has not been fully characterized. Specifically, Coweeta is underlain by, among other rock types, a Precambrian-age biotite gneiss of the Tallulah Falls Formation of the Blue Ridge Belt, a geology that is prevalent throughout much of Western NC. In Subbasin 34 the biotite gneiss is interlayered with pelitic schist and metagraywackes, and a body of ultramafic amphibolite and horneblend gneiss occurs near the ridgeline. Topography within the 82-acre Subbasin 34 is fairly steep and extends from about 3900 ft above mean seal level (msl) along the ridgeline to about 2900 ft msl at Shope Fork. Ground water discharge occurs along Bee Branch and Shope Fork. Bee Branch is a tributary to Shope Fork, which in turn empties into Coweeta Creek. Coweeta Creek empties into the Little Tennessee River. Gage records exist for Bee Branch back to 1938. A wide range of hydrogeologic data would be collected and analyzed for the basin, and findings would be compared to those of other hydrogeologic settings in the Inner Piedmont and Blue Ridge Belts of western NC.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3063.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3063.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9627</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Subbasin 34, Coweeta Watershed</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

We have observed remarkable changes in the production of heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates, and consequent effects on ecosystem function in terms of decomposition rates and carbon balance. As a result of our long-term nutrient enrichment, fungal production and activity dramatically increased, decay rates of leaf litter increased, benthic organic matter standing crop has been reduced and export of fine particulate organic matter has increased. Long-term data from these streams indicate that benthic invertebrate production is highly correlated with benthic organic matter. Thus, despite increased invertebrate biomass and production we observed after 2 years of enrichment, we predict that over longer time scales (&gt; 4 yr.), annual invertebrate production will return to a lower stable mean in the treatment stream, based on carbon limitation. The first objective of this study was to continue the nutrient enrichment of this headwater stream for one year to examine longer-term trends in system changes. The effects we have observed in this system have been largely driven by fungal rather than bacterial response, suggesting a keystone role of fungi in driving the response of a detritus-based system to nutrient enrichment. The second objective of the study, therefore, is to determine the role of fungi in controlling the system-wide response to nutrient addition. We are currently testing the keystone role of fungi by reducing fungal response to enrichment (by continuous addition of a fungicide) and measuring changes in the response of other variables. Critical to our predictions is whether there is a synergistic, facilitative relationship between fungi and bacteria, or whether these groups of microbes compete (e.g., for labile carbon or nutrients). Whether bacteria respond positively or negatively to reductions in fungi will test these alternative hypotheses. To the extent that microbial diversity and production is important to invertebrate production and ecosystem function will also be shown via differences in production and litter processing following reductions in fungi. This study will add to our understanding of mechanisms driving detritus-based system response to nutrient enrichment and the role of microbial diversity in ecosystem functioning.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3067.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3067.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9633</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Watersheds 53 and 54.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

In the southern Appalachians, eastern hemlock is the only coniferous tree that commonly grows along streams. Organic matter inputs (such as leaves, needles, and wood) from riparian trees are the major energy source in headwater stream food chains and play important roles in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in streams. Relative to inputs from hardwoods, conifer organic matter is slow to break down in fresh water and can serve different functions. A shift from hemlock to hardwood dominance in riparian areas may have significant impacts for transformations and transport of particulate and dissolved materials in streams. The loss of small wood inputs, or twigs, from hemlock trees may be especially important. We hypothesize that hemlock twigs influence organic matter and nutrient dynamics in headwater streams because they have unique physical and chemical characteristics that make them effective retainers of organic matter. We added hemlock twigs to one stream and hardwood twigs to a second stream and are measuring their effects by quantifying organic matter standing stocks, ammonium uptake, and leaf transport distance.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3069.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3069.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9635</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Little Hurricane Branch downstream of WS3 Tributary of Camprock Branch on WS10</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

We will conduct an adult removal experiment and mark-recapture techniques to assess the effects of adult density on juvenile demography in six study reaches. Initial sampling, marking, and adult removals will be conducted in early June 2002. Subsequent sampling of sculpin populations will be conducted in late summer 2002 and again in June 2003.

experiment C011.  For a description of the plot layout, see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e011/e011.html"&gt;E011&lt;/A&gt;.
For a list of fertilizer treatments for each plot, see file

was to measure the intensity of above and below-ground competition along a
gradient of soil resource availability.  Neighbor effects were quantified by
measuring the biomass, growth, morphology and survivorship of three species
transplanted into vegetation along a gradient of soil nitrogen availability.
Transplants were used to test for an inverse relationship between above and
below-ground competition, variation in the intensity of competition at
different levels of nutrient availability, and reversal of competitive
hierarchies.  Eight plots of each nitrogen treatment were randomly selected
and used for competition experiments.  Three competition treatments were used
to measure the above and below-ground effects of neighbors on transplanted
seedlings at each rate of nitrogen supply.  Transplants were grown in subplots
with no neighbors, or in subplots with the roots but not shoots of neighbors,
or in subplots with all above- and below-ground parts of neighbors present.
No neighbor treatments were imposed by driving a ring of galvanized sheet
steel (50cm in diameter, 15cm tall) into the ground until the top of it was at
the soil surface and then killing all the plants in the enclosed circle with a
systemic, rapidly decomposing herbicide (Roundup).  Transplants were grown
with only the roots of neighbors using white plastic garden net (50x50cm;
mesh:1x2cm) to tie back the shoots and leaves of neighbors so that a
transplant in the center of the net was not shaded by neighbors but was
surrounded by neighbor roots.  The all neighbors treatment consisted of a
transplant grown in the center of a 50cm x 50cm subplot of undisturbed
vegetation.  Treatments were replicated five times for each of three
transplanted species in each of the 8 replicate plots for each of the three
levels of the experimental nitrogen gradient.  Thus, the 24 plots of the
nitrogen gradient (3 nitrogen levels x 8 replicates used in the competition
experiment) each contained 45 subplots(3 competition treatments x 3
transplanted species x 5 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant
of a single species in one competition treatment.  A total of 1080 seedlings

The oaks are a major component of southern Appalachian forests and are also major components of the allochthonous organic matter that provides energy to southern Appalachian streams. Oaks are susceptible to a variety of defoliators including the gypsy moth which is gradually moving down the spine of the Blue Ridge Mts. and will likely eventually reach Coweeta and the surrounding mountains. American chestnut was at one time a dominant forest tree in the southern Appalachians but is now virtually extinct except for snags that grow from old stumps and roots. We have documented that litter breakdown of various leaf species is consistently faster in Big Hurricane Branch than in Hugh White Creek and this has been the case over the last 20 years or so. This study will compare breakdown rates of two major canopy trees of the maturing forest in the two stream types to develop background information on the importance of potential loss of substantial numbers of these two tree species to gypsy moth defoliation. The chestnut experiment is being done in an attempt to gain some historical perspective on how the loss of a key canopy species might have affected stream detritus dynamics.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:57:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3056.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3056.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9656</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Three first order tribs (T) on Hugh White Creek.

Long-term introduction of fine sediments is typical in agricultural catchments and may affect stream structure and function through alteration of the hyporheic zone. Chemical and physical qualities of introduced sediment may cause changes in biogeochemical characteristics and ecosystem structure of the hyporheic zone, subsequently changing its function. Changes in size and distribution of hyporheic sediments may also result in reduced hydraulic conductivity, limiting exchange with channel water and altering whole-stream function. The objective of the proposed research is to determine how agricultural sedimentation of southern Appalachian 2nd-3rd order streams affects stream structure and function through hyporheic alteration. This objective will be met through two research elements conducted in agricultural and forested streams. The first will test the effects of sedimentation on hyporheic structure and function at a bedform scale. The second will investigate how hyporheic sediment alteration at bedform scales affects stream structure and biogeochemical function at a reach/segment scale.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3056.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3056.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9657</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>WS11, Cunningham Creek, low gradient section downstream from weir for WS32; Dryman Fork, low gradient section ~1 km downstream from parking area at the end of road 421.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Many predictions of range redistributions take only absolute value shifts into account, but gradient strength may influence species� ability to adapt to local conditions. In steep gradients, gene flow between adjacent populations occupying very different environments may inhibit local adaptation in each. At the boundaries of their distributions, species may not be able to adapt to conditions as extreme as would be possible in shallower gradients, where gene flow would exert less of a retarding influence. I will investigate traits and factors influencing the upstream and downstream distributional limits of the Appalachian prosobranch snail Goniobasis proxima as a means for testing this hypothesis.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:04Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3055.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3055.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9658</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Nantahala River and tributaries, upstream of Nantahala Lake (very likely); Coweeta Creek and tributaries (possible); Betty Creek and tributaries (possible).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Disturbances include altering riparian or catchment vegetation, increasing sedimentation, and elevating nutrient levels, which affect leaf litter input and leaf breakdown. The quantity and quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs may be a major factor affecting stream ecosystem function, however, few studies have assessed it. It is necessary to study stream organic matter dynamics in order to understand the effect of agricultural disturbance on stream ecosystems.

These relationships are currently not available to GDOT for this region. Shope Fork was identified as an appropriate location for the measurement of hydraulic geometry in a gaged stream. A stable reach will be selected that is approximately 20 bankfull widths in length. Cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys along with pebble counts will be performed on the study reach to obtain channel dimension, plan, profile and sediment distribution data. Field-determined bankfull indicators will be associated with bankfull discharge from the weir. Annual peak discharge data for Weir 8 will be analyzed using Log Pearson Type III distributions, and the results used to determine the recurrence interval for the field-determined bankfull discharge. The relationship between the drainage area for Shope Fork and bankfull discharge, cross-sectional area, width and depth will be used along with similar data from other gaged streams to derive bankfull hydraulic geometry equations for the region.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3059.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3059.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9661</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Shope Fork, downstream of Weir 8; study reach will be approx. 20 bankfull widths in length.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

The three stream sites at Coweeta will the reference sites for studies in the Little Tennessee Basin.  Our research will evaluate whether streams are important sites of N retention in the landscape and, more importantly, how human disturbances affect that retention. We will use field 15N-tracer experiments to determine the rates and factors controlling nitrate uptake and retention in relatively pristine streams and in streams that have been altered by agriculture or urban development and have elevated nitrate levels. These experiments and associated measurements will allow us to test a variety of hypotheses dealing with the impacts of human disturbances on streams, including effects on channel morphology, hydraulics, biological activity, and N retention. At each of eight sites distributed across diverse biomes throughout the U.S., we will perform tracer-level 15N-nitrate addition experiments to trace the fate of nitrate in nine streams: 3 reference, 3 agricultural and 3 urban streams (for a total of 72 streams across all sites). Each experiment will consist of a 24-h addition of 15N-nitrate and longitudinally distributed measurements of 15N in water and in various benthic organic matter pools to determine in-situ rates of nitrification, assimilatory uptake of nitrate, and denitrification in each stream. We will use our experimental results to develop a general, process-based model of nitrate retention in stream reaches. We then will extend our results to much larger spatial scales by combining our stream model with GIS-based information on hydrography and land use to predict nitrate retention in 5th or 6th order river basins at each of the eight study sites. We will test these predictions with synoptic field measurements of stream nitrate concentrations within each basin. The validated river basin model will be an important land-use planning and management tool for controlling the N loading of lakes and coastal ecosystems.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:58:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3058.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3058.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9662</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Hugh White Creek 278222, 3881527; Ball Creek 276195, 3880467</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

 E004 that were used in E060.  Pairs of 9 m x 9 m plots
were demarcated.  One
plot in each pair was randomly assigned to exclude birds (BEX) and the other
to allow birds to forage for grasshoppers in the vegetation (BAL).  A frame
was built around BEX plots with wooden posts at each corner and heavy aluminum
wire stretched between posts 1m above the ground.  Bird netting (2.5 cm mesh)
was then stretched over this framework and attached to the ground with
numerous wire stakes. In 1989, these plots were set up 15 July, but were set
up 15 May in 1990 to examine the effects of predation in the early summer.
Between 15-25 August, netting was removed and grasshoppers were sampled within
both BEX and BAL plots and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification to
species or genus, counting and weighing. Grasshoppers were sampled by two
people with butterfly nets. After the grasshoppers were sampled, the
vegetation was sampled. Within each 9 m x 9 m plot, three 0.1 m x 3 m strips
were clipped, sorted to species, dried and weighed.  In 1990, the exclosures
were set up 15 May, but all vegetation and grasshopper sampling was similar to
that in 1989.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
