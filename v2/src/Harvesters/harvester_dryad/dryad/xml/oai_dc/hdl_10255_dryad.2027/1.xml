     Site Location

     The North Inlet LTER is located on the eastern coast of the Atlantic
     Ocean in a small tidal estuary (area = 2630 hectares) near Georgetown, 
     South Carolina, USA.  Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are 
     longitude 79 degrees 10 minutes and latitude 33 degrees 21 minutes.   
     Motile epibenthic sled collections were made from one or two locations
     along Town Creek, towing with the path of the ebbing tidal current. 
     The DD (Debidue) site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and
     Debidue Creek.  The 100 m tow path followed a transect beginning at a
     fixed point on Debidue Island and followed the shoreline due south
     (approx. 5 m from shore) in line with a large heavily vegetated dune
     on North Island.  The tow path terminated on a line with the boilers
     of a sunken ship and the tip of Debidue Island (looking to the NE). 
     Each tow lasted approx. 5 minutes depending on tidal velocity.

     The BB (Bread and Butter) site is located along the western
     shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.  
     Each of three sequential tows began at a small (1 m wide) drainage
     creek about 50m south of Clambank Creek confluence.  The tow was
     started about 5 m from the edge of the marsh and ended about 30 m from
     the edge of the marsh.


     The tow path extended to a line between the Clambank tower and the
     first small drainage southwest of Boze's Creek mouth.  Each tow lasted
     approx. 5 min. depending upon tidal velocity.  For further
     information, consult the maps of sample locations on file.

     Site Character

     The DD (Debidue) site near Town Creek mouth and North Inlet, is 
     characterized by a high energy sandy bottom with regular ridges and 
     swales.  Depth along the tow path averages 3-4 m at sampling time. 
     The tidal amplitude of .5 m is typical.  The bottom is sand with
     little or no hard substrate (shell, rock).  Seasonal growths of
     bryozoan and algae occur.  Generally, little or no organic matter is
     collected in the epibenthic sled.

     The BB (Bread and Butter) site is located along Town Creek 
     approximately 2 km from the inlet mouth.  At this location the creek
     is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes.  The inter tidal
     zone is covered by clusters of the American oyster (Crassostrea
     virginica), shell rubble and intermittent muddy flats.  The bottom
     supports seasonal growths of sponges, algae, hydroids, bryozoans, and
     soft corals as well as oysters.  Much of the bottom habitat is sandy
     mud covered by varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal
     material.  Depth along the tow path ranges from 2-4 m at sampling.

     Town Creek is a high salinity creek dominated by semi-diurnal tides.

     Rain input, primarily runoff, depresses salinities briefly (hours -
     days) depending on duration and frequency.  Water temperatures mirror
     local air conditions:  warm temperate.  See Temperature and Salinity
     data for further details.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-79.2936 W

Infaunal and epifaunal molluscs were hand-collected from within quadrats of known area from mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in formalin, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, measured and counted (count data is reported separately). Length of each measurable individual was determined using calipers or small etched rulers under a stereomicroscope. Species abundance and density data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-0412b1.

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice.

Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.

The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh).  Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion.  The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot.  Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set.

Soil C content of the approximate  A horizon (top 15 cm) of soil was measured during the summer of  1994 on windward, leeward, upslope and downslope sides, and  interiors of tree islands on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA. A  subset of samples from these sites were also used for CHN  analysis and were measured for total phosphorus using persulfate  digestions and colorimetric measurements. Results indicate  significant (p&amp;lt;.0001) reductions of percent of dry mass  represented by C in soil and significant (p&amp;lt;.04) declines in  absolute C storage among soils on the windward sides of tree  islands as compared to the upslope and downslope controls, and a  tendency for reduced C on the leeward sides as well. Surface  organic matter (O horizon) accumulations averaging 9.6 +/- 1.02  kg/m^2 are found in the interior of tree islands, but this  material, in addition to roots, is not stabilized in the A  horizons of soil. The movement of tree islands can therefore be  regarded as disturbances to soil building processes in alpine  tundra. Timberline forest and adjacent tundra patches of similar  aspect and slope were also sampled for comparisons of soil C  content.  Results indicated similar C storage beneath trees and  tundra at this lower elevation. The wind-induced movement of  tree islands across the tundra creates enhanced snowpack within  the trees and on their leeward sides. Shading and moisture  conditions of the soil are altered, leading to C deposition and decomposition dynamics which differ from that of unimpacted  tundra surface soils. However, at timberline, adjacent tundra  lacks the ability to exhibit the enhanced C storage of alpine  tundra at higher elevations. Snowpack within trees and adjacent  tundra at timberline may be relatively constant such that  biophysical factors affecting soil characteristics are relatively  unchanged by plant life-form.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:49:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:49:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.144.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.144.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9422</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

The system used consisted of a Tektronics 1502B  reflectometer, a Tektronics SP232 interface module, a Compaq LTEg232 PC,  coaxial cable, and a probe that was left semi-permanently in the soil.  The reflectometer generated an electrical step voltage pulse which was  propagated down the cable to the probe. The reflected voltage waveform  was measured, stored, and displayed by the reflectometer and the  Tektronics SP232 interface module. The waveform is represented as a  2-dimensional data array, with the x-axis representing time (which is  converted to distance using the dielectric constant of the cable) and the  y-axis representing voltage for the given time: in this system this value  is represented in millirho units (Tektronics 1991). The length of the  waveform is determined by measuring the difference between the soil air  interface (SAI) and the end of the voltage step reflection (RE). The SAI  value is equivalent to the apex of the first peak in the wave and the RE  value is equivalent to the intersection of tangents "drawn" at (a) the  bottom of the wave and (b) the point of the steepest rise (see Taylor  and Seastedt 1992). The waveform length is then used to estimate the  volumetric and gravimetric moisture of the surrounding soil.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.140.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.140.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9429</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

Point Contact sampling consists of recording the diversity and abundance of invertebrates and algae along 11 transects of variable length extending from the upper intertidal to the low intertidal. Intertidal surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Intertidal coastal biodiversity surveys are conducted throughout the year at sites ranging from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. Selected sites are resampled on a 3-5 year cycle. A site is defined as a contiguous rocky bench of at least 30m.</dc:description><dc:contributor>DaveLohse</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:39Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/pisco_intertidal.50.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>pisco_intertidal.50.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9446</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>All sites: ALL: Point Contact surveys are conducted at discrete sites ranging from Southeast Alaska in the north to Baja California Sur, Mexico in the south.

Swath sampling consists of recording the number of seastars and abalone on eleven 2m wide transects of variable length extending from the upper intertidal to the low intertidal. Intertidal surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Intertidal coastal biodiversity surveys are conducted throughout the year at sites ranging from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. Selected sites are resampled on a 3 to 5 year cycle. A site is defined as a contiguous rocky bench of at least 30m.</dc:description><dc:contributor>DaveLohse</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:46Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/pisco_intertidal.51.6/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>pisco_intertidal.51.6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9448</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Graves Harbor AK: IGHAXX: Alaska: USA: Swath surveys are conducted at discrete sites ranging from Southeast Alaska in the north to Baja California Sur, Mexico in the south.

Quadrat sampling consists of recording the number of mobile invertebrate species within thirty-three 0.5m x 0.5m quadrats placed along 11 transects of variable length extending from the upper intertidal to the low intertidal. Intertidal surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Intertidal coastal biodiversity surveys are conducted throughout the year at sites ranging from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. Selected sites are resampled on a 3-5 year cycle. A site is defined as a contiguous rocky bench of at least 30m.</dc:description><dc:contributor>DaveLohse</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/pisco_intertidal.52.7/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>pisco_intertidal.52.7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9450</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Graves Harbor AK: IGHAXX:  Alaska: USA: Quadrat surveys are conducted at discrete sites ranging from Southeast Alaska in the north to Baja California Sur, Mexico in the south.

Topography sampling consists of recording the elevation (relative to mean low low water) along 11 transects of variable length extending from the upper intertidal to the low intertidal. Intertidal surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Intertidal coastal biodiversity surveys are conducted throughout the year at sites ranging from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. Selected sites are resampled on a 3-5 year cycle. A site is defined as a contiguous rocky bench of at least 30m.</dc:description><dc:contributor>DaveLohse</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:50:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/pisco_intertidal.53.7/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>pisco_intertidal.53.7</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9451</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Graves Harbor AK: IGHAXX: Alaska: USA: Topography surveys are conducted at discrete sites ranging from Southeast Alaska in the north to Baja California Sur, Mexico in the south.

The presence of tree islands (krummholz) on the tundra acts as a 'snowfence' causing snow to drift within the krummholz and in a semi-circular area leeward of the krummholz. This drifting causes  soil within and leeward of the krummholz to have a much deeper, more consistent and longer lasting snow-cover than the adjacent tundra soils. The snowdrifts form a permanent cover over the leeward and krummholz sites from November through June, helping to insulate the soils beneath from the extreme low temperatures and supplying significantly more meltwater in the spring. In contrast, high winds cause the adjacent tundra to be free from snow and exposed to extremely cold temperatures for much of the winter. Studies have shown that atmospheric nitrogen deposition accumulates on snowpacks throughout the winter months and that this is released as a 'pulse' of nitrogen ions at snowmelt (Williams et al. 1996). We hypothesized that accumulation of snowpacks in krummholz and leeward sites may alter nitrogen dynamics in these areas relative to tundra, by either (a) affecting microbial activity via its insulating effect or (b) accumulating large amounts of atmospherically deposited N and releasing it as a pulse at snowmelt. This study sought to examine the nitrogen inputs into tundra,  krummholz, and leeward soils over an entire winter season (using buried ion exchange resin bags which collect ions percolating down at snowmelt and early spring rains) and over a short period in spring, immediately following snowmelt (using microlysimeters to collect soil water over a 24 hour period). Belowground NPP (determined from root ingrowth cores) and d13C values of tundra and krummholz vegetation are also presented in this file. NH4+ and NO3- concentrations of soil water collected over 24 hours (from microlysimeters) were not significantly different at krummholz and tundra sites. In contrast, inputs of NO3- and NH4+ over the entire winter season were affected by site. The amount of NH4+ collected from tundra soils was significantly lower than from krummholz soils but was not significantly lower than that from leeward soils. In contrast, the amount of NO3- from tundra soils was lower than both krummholz and leeward (although this was not quite statistically significant, p= 0.09). To summarize, consistently (although not significantly) greater winter inputs of NO3- were found in areas with the greatest snow accumulation (i.e. krummholz and leeward sites) but this was not the case for NH4+ inputs. Williams et al (1996) suggest that NH4+ released from snow may be immobilized in underlying soils and this might explain why high levels of NH4+ were not detected at leeward sites. However, in order to fully understand the mechanisms that determine the relative winter N inputs at these sites, all the N fluxes (including N inputs in snow and meltwater and microbial activity) must be investigated. Belowground NPP was significantly lower in krummholz sites than tundra sites. This is consistent with much of the literature in which turnover of fine roots in grassland ecosystems greatly exceeds that of forests. The d13C value of stems of conifers was significantly less negative than that of all other vegetative material collected, indicating less discrimination of heavy isotopes in the stem than in other tissues and in tundra vegetation.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:21Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.134.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.134.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9464</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

The response of soil KCl extractable NO3- also showed this trend but was not statistically significant. Holtmeir and Broll (1992) suggested that the depletion of organics and nutrients following the passage of tree island may be associated with a reduced clay content. We analyzed a subsample of these soils for cation exchange capacity (CEC) and texture. We did not  find significantly lower clay content in soils under or adjacent to  krummholz compared with those from undisturbed tundra. In fact, percent  clay was greater in krummholz and windward sites than in tundra sites.  The percent clay of windward sites was significantly greater in windward  soils than either krummholz or tundra soils. Clearly, depletion of organics  following the passage of tree islands does not appear to be associated with  a depleted clay content. We found that CEC was very highly significantly correlated with percent organic content (using percent organic data only  from the subset of soils on which CEC was measured). Therefore, the CEC  content of these soils would appear to be strongly associated with the  organic content but not with the clay content. Percent soil moisture was  significantly higher directly underneath the krummholz compared with the  other sites. There was no effect of treatment on pH. We also investigated whether the organic matter lost in association with krummholz colonization  (i.e. 1m from the tree) was replenished as tundra vegetation recolonized  in the wake of the tree island. In order to do this we compared soils from  tundra sites in the wake of the tree islands (5m or 10m windward of the  tree -a distance that represents approximately 250 and 500 years since  krummholz colonization) with soils from undisturbed tundra sites. We found  no significant difference in organic matter contents along the windward  transect, indicating that recovery of organic matter content following colonization by krummholz is an extremely sow process. The soil samples were collected on 7 sampling dates in the summers of 1995 and 1996 and all the variables are listed by their separate sampling dates in this file.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:23Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.133.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.133.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9465</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve.

This data forms part of a study which seeks to further examine how changes in  carbon storage capacity are associated with changes in soil physical properties. Soils were collected in 1994. We sought to determine whether there were changes in natural abundance of C and N isotopes associated with previously reported changes in C and N content. Any such changes in natural abundance of C and N isotopes may indicate differences in inputs to the ecosystem or differences in ecosystem processes that may account for the differences in N and C content that have been observed. In addition to measuring ratios of natural isotopes  of C and N, we also measured C and N contents to provide a comparison with  previous studies. In order to convert % N and C values to Kgs of N and C  per m2 we used bulk density values, meaned across sampling dates, that had  been previously measured for these sites (these raw data are available at: http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?krmslblk.ts).  When N and C soil contents were considered on a percentage basis, levels  at windward sites were significantly lower than those of undisturbed tundra,  but levels directly beneath krummholsz were not significantly different from tundra soils. Bulk density was significantly lower under krummholz  than other sites. Thus when N and C amounts were expressed on a volume  (Kg m2, to a depth of 15cm) , they were significantly lower in both  krummholz and windward sites than in undisturbed tundra. D13C values  of soils under krummholz were significantly less negative under krummholz  than from windward or undisturbed tundra sites. A less negative d13C value is indicative of less discrimination and may be attributable to either vegetation differences or differences in decomposition rates.  D13C signatures of krummholz and tundra vegetation were also examined and are available at: http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?krmslrts.ts</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2001</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:40Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.132.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.132.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9473</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied.

The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species.The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures.

The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:51:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.7999123.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.7999123.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9479</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.
