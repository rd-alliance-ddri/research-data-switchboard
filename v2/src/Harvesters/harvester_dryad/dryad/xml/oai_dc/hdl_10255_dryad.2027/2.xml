By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied.

Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species.

The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter, Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.7999120.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.7999120.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9491</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues.

Taylor Instruments Min-Max thermometers were mounted approximately  50 cm above ground on the north side of the same stakes, sheltered by  tin and plastic shields. The current time, current temperature, maximum  temperature and minimum temperature were recorded. Minimum and maximum  temperature markers were reset to the current temperature. Proximity to  the surface and inadequate shielding resulted in anomalously high  temperature readings, particularly on sunny days.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:28Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.128.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.128.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9496</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

Assemblages span the last  10,000 years revealing climate change and the response of both insects and vegetation in the montane to upper subalpine zones. The Longs Peak Inn  Bog site (LPIB) yielded insect assemblages ranging in age from recent  to 3500 yr BP. This insect fossil record suggests climatic cooling at about 1800 yr BP and between 250 and 300 yr BP (AD 1700-1850). The bog may experience colder microclimates than the surrounding forests,  yielding insect assemblages reflective of the colder, local microclimate. Also, alpine and upper subalpine insects may have been washed into the catchment basin of the bog from nearby slopes. Assemblages from four additional Front Range sites suggested a climatic optimum between  9000 and 7000 BP. Faunal evidence indicates a tree-limit decline at 4500 BP. Declining forest-tundra insect ratios, combined with the  conifer macrofossil record, suggest a climatic deterioration from  4500 to 3100 BP followed by a rapid amelioration, from 3000 to 2000 BP. A gradual decline in the forest-tundra ratios occurred after  2000 BP, reaching 1:1 ratios at or before 1000 BP.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:51Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.121.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.121.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9504</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

Associated plant biomass, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus levels,  were determined. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus, moisture, and temperature  also were measured. The relationships between these factors and  mycorrhizal development were examined. Mycorrhizal development  corresponded with phosphorus accumulation in R. adoneus. This  accumulation occurred late in the growing season after seed set, when plants were producing new tissues for the next year and appears to  allow the plants to bloom the next year when snowmelt begins. Edaphic factors such as soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil N and P levels did not correlate with patterns in mycorrhizal development. In contrast to the pattern of P uptake, R. adoneus took up nitrogen (N) very early in the growing season during snowmelt, when availablitity was high, new roots had not yet formed, and old roots contained high levels of dark septate (DS) fungus.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1995</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:52:53Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.120.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.120.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9505</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

Crab abundance was determined by counting the number of crab holes within a 625 cm^2 quadrat and converting the counts to number per square meter.  Counts were made in the mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 per zone) at all sites.  This method does not differentiate which species made a particular hole and therefore only estimates total crab abundance.  Plugged holes were excluded from the counts.  Mean density across all sites and zones was 171 m^-2 (+/- 292 s.d.).</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KennethHelm</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>CarolineMcFarlin</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>BeckyGreene</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>WayneListing</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JoshAvitan</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JenniferLindell</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.226.22/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.226.22</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9517</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-0411a, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied.

Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species.

The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter, Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:22Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.7998120.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.7998120.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9518</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Counts were made in the mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 per zone) at all sites.  This method does not differentiate which species made a particular hole and therefore only estimates total crab abundance.  Plugged holes were excluded from the counts.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied.

The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species.The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures.

The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:38Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.7998123.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.7998123.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9525</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Six sites  characterized by relatively shallow snowpacks were sampled in 1993.   A total of 27 sites were sampled in 1994. Nine of the 1994 sites  were located in the naturally shallow snowfield sampled in 1993,  9 sites were located in a formerly shallow snowpack site where snow  depth was augmented by the construction of a 2.8-m high, 60-m long snowfence, and the 9 remaining sites were located in a naturally  deep snowpack. Concentrations of N2O and CO2 at the soil surface  were measured monthly from January until March, biweekly through  April, and weekly until snowmelt was complete. Elevated levels of  CO2 under the snowpack, suggesting microbial activity, were first  observed under the shallow snowpacks in early March of 1993. N2O  production under snow was first observed in April 1993, when soil  temperatures had warmed above -3 degrees C. In 1994 shallow  snowpack sites exhibited diminished and sporadic production of both  CO2 and N2O, apparently due to the inconsistent snow cover compared  to 1993. The snowfence sites exhibited increased CO2 and N2O fluxes  beginning in February 1994. Both CO2 and N2O fluxes from the  snowfence site were similar to those measured under the naturally  deep snowpack. These data suggest that the timing and depth of snow  cover during the alpine winter control microbial activity by  insulating soils from extreme air temperatures. To obtain a  regional perspective on subnivean trace gas fluxes, both CO2 and  N2O samples were determined at sites below treeline on Niwot Ridge and at Loch Vale in Rocky Mountain National Park.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.116.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.116.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9527</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

Kobresia myosuroides foliage collected from Niwot Ridge  was dried and placed into 10x20 cm litter bags. About 2 g of plant  material were placed in the litter bags. One-hundred and sixty (160) litter bags were constructed of polyester mesh with a mesh size of  2mm^2. Forty (40) litter bags were placed inside of gopher mounds,  at the interface between the mounded (gopher excavated) soil and  the original soil surface (top of the O horizon), located on a  slope with a southern aspect. An additional 40 litter bags were placed  on the soil surface near these gopher mounds. The remaining 80 bags were similarly paired on gopher mounds and undisturbed soils on a  slope with a northern aspect. All litter bags were placed in the  field on 1 July 1993, and an initial harvest was done on the same date in order to assess the effect of handling and transport to the field. The second harvest was undertaken on 11 September 1993, at which time 31 bags were harvested. Retrieved litter bags were dried at  80 degrees Celsius for approximately 24 hr. The litter was removed from  the litter bags and weighed. Litter weight loss was calculated to  estimate decomposition rates. Four remaining harvests are scheduled: spring 1994, autumn 1994, spring 1995, and autumn 1995.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Niwot Ridge LTER/University of Colorado1560 30th Street, CB 450BoulderCO80309USAlternwt@colorado.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:53:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nwt.117.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-nwt.117.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9531</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>-105.643   W

Vertical CTD profiles were collected at 2-4km intervals from the -4km to 24km upriver along the transect during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure, optical back scatter, photosynthetically-available radiation, oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected during the upcast were deleted. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KiRyongKang</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2005</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:55:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:55:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.205.22/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.205.22</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9582</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set PHY-GCEM-0404a2, based on geographic coordinates present in the data table</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA.
