	In the summer of 1992, LTER experiment 111 was initiated.  A new monoculture garden was set up adjacent to the existing competition gardens (LTER experiments 26, &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e055/e055.html"&gt;55&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e069/e069.html"&gt;69&lt;/A&gt; and 70).  The 160 total plots consist of two plot sizes, large (5'x8') and small (5'x4') were built using sheet metal pounded into the ground.  The entire garden is surrounded by a 6 foot tall fence above ground and a 4 foot tall fence below ground to exclude herbivores.  Seeds were planted in the fall of 1992.

        Appropriate treatments were administered to each experiment and sampling was done according to sampling schedules
during the 1992 field season.</dc:description><dc:date>1989</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:26Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.67897111.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.67897111.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9287</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Fishes and crayfishes were excluded from areas of both streams using an electric exclusion technique; chlorophyll a, ash free dry mass (AFDM), and invertebrates were sampled over a 40-day period. In both streams, chlorophyll a and AFDM were higher in exclusion than control areas, although these trends were not consistently significant across all sampling dates. In Jones Creek, significantly more large (&gt; 4 mm) aquatic insect larvae were found in exclusion that control areas, most likely due to exclusion treatments providing a refuge from macrobiotic predators. This refuge effect was also evident in Ball Creek, were exclusion treatments contained significantly more filterers. Results indicate that macrobiota influence the structure of southern Appalachian benthic communities, by decreasing the amount of organic matter (algal and detrital) available for other consumers and by preferentially preying upon certain sizes and taxa of invertebrates. Compared to some low-order tropical streams, however, macrobiotic influences are low. Weaker effects may be attributed to decreased abundance of macrobiota and increased influence of benthic insects in southern Appalachian streams.1.None Available</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:34Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3010.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3010.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9290</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>None Available</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Using mark-recapture techniques, we characterized the movements and space use behaviors of juvenile and adult mottled sculpin in a southern Appalachian stream. We then related these behaviors to spatial variation in benthic invertebrate colonization rates and small scale changes in local prey abundance. Observations made on the individual movements of sculpin indicated two distinct behavioral patterns: 1)despotic patch use, and 2)periodic patch abandonment. Our results on prey patch dynamics indicated that these behaviors were mediated by spatio-temporal variation in invertebrate distribution and dispersal. Adult sculpin maintained activities within patches of high prey abundance and exhibited persistent use of patches characterized by high invertebrate colonization rates. In addition, we found that patch abandonment by adult sculpin was induced by changes in the local abundance of invertebrate prey. In contrast to adults, patch use by juveniles appeared to be controlled primarilly by size-dependent competitive interactions. These results indicate that the dynamics of patch use by sculpin are controlled simultaneously by the dynamics of their patchily distributed prey and age/size dependent competitive interactions.1.We sampled sculpin population seasonally (Spring, Early and Late Summer, Autumn) in each of four years (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997). Within each season we made a series of four sampling passes. During each pass we snorkeled the study site and capture individual sculpin with dip nets. Individuals were

weighed (nearest .01g) and measured (nearest 1mm) and given a unique mark using acrylic paints injected subcutaneously. We mapped the location of each individual using triangulation procedures. Individual movements were characterized as the distance between subsequent captures of the same individual over time. We measured microhabitat variables at each location (depth, current velocity, and substrate composition). We quantified invertebrate abundances within patches occupied by sculpin. We related movements by sculpin to changes in prey abundance and we quantified

invertebrate colonization rates in areas used persistently by sculpin.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3011.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3011.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9291</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Shope Fork just below weir 8</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

At the scale of individual stones, we failed to detect a significant correlation between prey density/stone and longnose dace for aging effort (# bites/stone), even though there were large differences (i.e. up to 200x) in prey density among individual stones. At the foraging patch scale, longnose dace chose patches with significanlty greater prey densities than were available from randomly selected stones in summer and spring, when prey were distributed in distinct patches, but did not select high-prey patches in fall, when prey were uniformly distributed. In addition, longnose dace avoided patches with depositional physical characteristics in all seasons. At the reach scale, longnose dace were signficnatly under-represented in depositional reaches in all seasons. Among erosional reaches, prey density was significantly different among reaches in all seasons, and prey density/reach was positively correlated with longnose dace density/reach in all seasons. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of physical variable and prey concurrently affect habitat use by longnose dace at multiple scales.1.Data were collected by directly observing actively foraging longnose dace through snorkeling. We snorkeled the site until 20 long nose dace had been observed in each season. We observed each longnose dace until it had foraged upon 4-5 stones, recoreded the number of bites taken from each stone, and placed brightly colored lead weights adjacent to each stone. Once 20 fish had been observed, we centered a 400 cm² viewer above each foraged upon stone and measured the following physical characteristics: depth, focal and mean (60% depth) current velocities, and substrate composition.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:45:37Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3012.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3012.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9292</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Watershed 9, Ball Creek, 100m section directly above weir 9</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

We will put groups of litter bags of white oak, red maple and rhododendron leaves in three first order tribs in WS 7 and 14 near the points of confluence with the mainstream, and at at least one terrestrial riparian site in each watershed. We will retrieve 3 bags of each species from each site at approximately monthly intervals over the course of about 8 months. The terrestrial bags will be retrieved about every 2 months for about 10 months. Litter will be rinsed of debris, dried, and weighed. Sub samples will be ashed at 500C to determine AFDM. Percent AFDM remaining will be regressed against time to determine breakdown rate (-k). Breakdown rates from streams will be compared to the longterm records of leaf breakdown we have on WS 14 and 7. The terrestrial rates are of interest to see how they compare to stream rates.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:46:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:46:16Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3002.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3002.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9308</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Watersheds 7 and 14</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Factorial experiments will be carried out that manipulate both litter quality (ie, using different leaf species) and the presence of macrobiota (ie, fish and crayfish). Electric exclusion hoops will be used for the macrobiota manipulation. The following hypotheses will be tested. H1) The relative impact of faunal consumers on litter decomposion rates will increase with increasing litter quality. H2) The impact of macroconsumers on decomposition will be high in stream habitats.1. sites will be selected in early May. Leaf packs of three leaf species, yellow poplar, chestnut oak and rhododendron, will be placed with electric exclusion hoops in these selected site. There will be 18 hoops in all, 50/50 charge/uncharged. This will take up about 30 m2 total area in the stream. 2.Leaf pack reps (3-4) will be removed over the time indicated above according to their predicted decay rates and a decay curve will be developed.  Rhododendron leaves will most likely be the only leaf packs left after August and will need to continue to be removed until November 2000. 3. Insects colonizing the leaf packs will be collected and analyzed for biomass and composition. 4. Leaf quality will be examined thought analysis of C:N ratios, N content, polyphenol content and lignification. The analysis will take place in Dr. Mark Hunter s Laboratory at UGA.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:46:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:46:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cwt.3000.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cwt.3000.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9310</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>the Lower Ball River below Kate Schofield s crayfish survey reach to above the confluence with Shope Fork</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:47:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:47:01Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799201.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799201.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9334</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

The use of helicopter’s and in particular the larger Bell Jet Ranger series is the most universally accepted aircraft for game count work. Game numbers are needed for calculations pertaining to herbivore stocking rate and the ability of the veld to carry these animals as well as  the effect, of their utilisation on the resource base. It is obvious therefore that no form of wildlife management is possible without reliable information regarding numbers. The helicopter survey approach has shortcomings which may include a lack of skilled observers, observer difficulty in standardisation and relatively high costs. The value in terms of management decisions that can be taken using the results far outweigh the costs of the exercise. It is imperative therefore that a skilled team is employed. Observer fatigue is reduced on small properties such as the one under discussion, while when one calculates the cost of the game and veld resources the costs are relatively small.</dc:description><dc:contributor>MikePingo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JohnPeel</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>AndreJacobs</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:47:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:47:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nikkis.19.9/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nikkis.19.9</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9336</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Central lowveld</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>30.52913 W

Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.</dc:description><dc:date>1994</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:47:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T14:47:10Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799202.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799202.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9338</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues. I will provide them with formal recognition that, at their discretion, may include co-authorship or acknowledgements on publications. I realize that the researchers who gathered these data may be using them for scientific analyses, papers or publications that are currently planned or in preparation, and that such activities have precedence over any that I might wish to prepare. In this case, my preparation of any work may be delayed, at the option of the Cedar Creek researchers involved, until their work is completed.  Because it may be possible to misinterpret a data set if it is taken out of context, I will seek the assistance and opinion of those Cedar Creek researchers involved in the design of a study and the collection of the data as I analyze the data. Moreover, I realize that this computer data set is not complete, and it may contain errors. The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

Given the relatively short life-spans of fine roots, understanding the relationship between fine root diameter and nutrient contents, and the extent to which nutrients are retranslocated prior to turnover, is important for estimating nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. 
To study patterns of nutrient concentrations in fine roots, we examined published accounts for roots [less than or equal] mm in diameter, building on the database of Jackson et al. (1996, 1997). The synthesized studies included data from a range of ecosystems and biomes, including grass, shrub, and tree functional types from temperate, tropical, boreal, and tundra systems. The preponderance of data came from experiments with temperate and coniferous trees. Study sites were a mixture of natural and manipulated ecosystems, including old growth, secondary growth, old fields, and plantations. Data from fertilized systems were excluded, as were results from pot or greenhouse experiments and studies with seedlings. Criteria for inclusion were that each study provide information on root status (i.e., live, dead, or undifferentiated) and that if a range of root sizes were reported (e.g., 1-3 mm, 3-5 mm) the reported range did not exceed 2.5 mm. For information on the 56 studies used for the database and the spreadsheet used in the calculations see the Appendix.
