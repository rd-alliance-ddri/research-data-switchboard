This data set consists of ninety estimates of live and total fine root biomass associated with Table 1 published in Jackson et al. (1977) (Jackson, R. B., H. A. Mooney, and E.-D. Schulze. 1997. A global budget for fine root biomass, surface area, and nutrient contents. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. 94:7362-7366). Expanded data on rooting profiles and nutrients are available in other data sets; however, these data represent a unique tabulation of fine root measurements.

Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assessment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for various plant functional groups.  

The initial data set (Jackson et al. 1996) was expanded to examine distributions of root budgets (Jackson et al. 1997). Measurements were selected from over 300 field studies. Results from the analysis showed that calculated root surface area is almost always greater than leaf area, more than an order of magnitude so in grasslands. The average C:N:P ratio in living fine roots is 450:11:1, and global fine root carbon is more than 5 percent of the magnitude of all carbon contained in the atmosphere. Assuming conservatively that fine roots turn over once per year, they represent 33 percent of global annual net primary productivity.

A PDF copy of the Jackson et al (1996) paper is available at http://www.biology.duke.edu/jackson/oecol96c.pdf, and a PDF copy of the Jackson et al. (1997) paper is available on-line at http://www.biology.duke.edu/jackson/PNAS97.htm.

This data set has been expanded and updated over the years to estimate root turnover rates (data for approximately 341 site-vegetation combinations for 188 site from 152 papers in Gill and Jackson 2000); studies of root nutrient concentrations (data for approximately 372 site-pit-depths from 57 papers in Gordon and Jackson 2000); and rooting depth (data for approximately 298 sites with 565 profiles in Schenk and Jackson 2002). The three recent papers include most of the data contained in the initial root data set; however, some observations may have been excluded because of more stringent selection criteria. Many of the source papers provided data for the three recent rooting papers and users are encouraged to review the three recent data sets. The file described at http://www-eosdis.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/fine_roots_biomass.html that provides estimates of both live and total fine root biomass for approximately 100 sites is unique to the collection of four data sets of root characteristics developed by Jackson and his collaborators.

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment.</dc:description><dc:date>1990</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:09:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:09:50Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.888802.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.888802.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9985</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied.

The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species.The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures.

The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops.</dc:description><dc:date>1999</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:09:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:09:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.120197123.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.120197123.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9987</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

grasshopper species from a community with natural (uncaged) grasshopper
densities.  During the summer, beginning in 1991, grasshoppers are removed
from forty, 2m x 4m plots in Field B, macroplot #6, according to the following
8 treatments:  (1) No grasshoppers removed, (2) All grasshoppers removed, (3)
All early season grasshopper species removed (Pardalophora apiculata
and Arphia conspersa), (4) All late season grasshopper species removed
(Melanoplus femur-rubrum, Phoetaliotes nebrascensis, conocephalus sp. +
others present),  (5) Melanoplus femur-rubrum removed, (6)
Phoetaliotes nebrascensis removed, (7) Conocephalus sp. removed,
(8) All late season grasshopper species with an average mass greater than 0.5g
are removed. Grasshopper removals will occur once a week from June1- September
7.  Grasshopper abundances will be sampled by capturing all individuals in a
plot in late June and late August.  Vegetation will be sampled in August by
clipping 10cm x 1.5m strips from within each plot, drying and weighing green
vegetation sorted to species.  Soil solution concentrations of ammonium and
nitrate will be determined in September from two soil samples from each plot.

There are 30, 2m x 2m plots.  These plots are in prairie openings in unmanipulated natural vegetation.  They were placed in a haphazard manner, being about 20m apart within an opening.  Each plot was divided into 16, 0.5m x 0.5m subplots.  Percent cover estimates of vegetation are done in September for each of the sixteen subplots in each of the 30 plots.

	In the month of June 1992, each of the 30 plots were divided into 4 sections.  Seeds of a combination of various species were added to two sections.  The other remaining two sections were used as controls.  There are 10 treatments in this experiment.  Each treatment consists of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 54 species randolmly pooled from a total of 54 species.  Each treatment is replicated six times.  These are true replicates of the number of species added but not of the species composition.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts. &lt;! in file trmte93.&gt;
Because of the immense size of this treatment file, it has been broken down by plot number.</dc:description><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:10:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:10:07Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799193.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799193.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.9992</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman.</dc:description><dc:date>1910</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:10:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:10:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.8899001.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.8899001.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10015</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

The complete data set includes extensive written documentation, which should be referenced to reduce the chance of errors in data and errors of interpretation.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>

     meiobenthic assemblages exhibited continuity over time and to monitor
     several physical variables to determine if these influenced long-term
     temporal patterns.  The most recent study focused on variation and the
     relations of meiobenthos abundance with environmental factors over 11
     years.  Typically marine benthic community studies are limited temporally
     and the majority of previously published 'longterm' meiofauna results (all

North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields  and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.   
     The study site is the North Inlet marsh, a 3000 hectare high salinity
     estuary dominated by Spartina alterniflora, located approximately 6 km 
     east of Georgetown, South Carolina.  The marsh is bordered on the east by
     two barrier islands; on the south by a larger brackish estuary, Winyah 
     Bay; and on the west and north by a mixed oak-pine forested peninsula.

     Debidue Site (DD) - Debidue is a sand-bottomed site located 
     approximately .5 km inside the Inlet mouth adjacent to the confluence of
     two major marsh creeks, Debidue and Town Creeks. The site is at the lower
     end of an extensive sand bar and is subject to strong current and wave
     action.

     Bread and Butter Site (BB) - This site is located on a muddy subtidal bank 
     of Bread and Butter Creek, about 100 m inside the mouth of this medium 
     sized creek.  The creek is 1.5 km SW of the Debidue site in the center of
     the marsh.  The creek is 10 m wide at low tide at the sample site and is
     sheltered from strong current and wave action.  The creek is lined with 
     mud banks and oyster bars and the sediment at the sampling site is fine,
     silty mud.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-79.2936 W

The sites are part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX), a collaboration of arctic and alpine researchers. ITEX programs have been in place throughout the circumpolar arctic and temperate alpine since 1992 or 1993. ITEX investigators use a common experimental design, work with a common set of species, and monitor common parameters of the ecosystem and physical environment. ITEX investigators seek to understand how the same species located in different geographical areas respond to warming and natural climatic variability, and how changes in those species and their environments will affect overall ecosystem structure and function. A common assumption in ecological studies is that patterns of response in species (or other groupings such as functional types or ecosystems) can be directly extrapolated to the range of the species or type. Such an assumption is necessary if data are to be used in modeling and extrapolation studies. The ITEX data will allow us to explicitly test this assumption by examining variability in tundra responses at multiple sites over 4-5 years. We have compiled and integrated data sets from ITEX research sites in order to test hypotheses of tundra response at a global scale using meta-analysis techniques.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Michael HuntJones</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:11:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:11:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.146.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.146.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10028</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Circumpolar alpine and arctic tundra; ITEX sites.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180 W

In order to compare parasite measures across the diverse range of host taxa studied (which varied in their parasite richness), we standardized parasite species richness (SPSR) for each population of hosts within each study as a proportion relative to the total number of parasite species found in all studies within the native range of that host species.  In addition, we compared both mean prevalence (averaged across parasite species for each host species and the summed prevalence (sum of all parasite species for each host species).  The latter measure gives an indication of the cumulative extent of parasitism (or potential impact of parasitism on a host population) that each host experiences14.  For each of these metrics, we estimated the proportional parasite release experienced by introduced species as: (N-I)/N, where N is the value for the native range and I is the value for the introduced range of the above metrics.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Kevin Lafferty</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>AndrewDobson</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ValerieMcKenzie</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ArmandKuris</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:11:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:11:36Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.142.4/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.142.4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10034</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>global (180W, 180E, 90N, and 90S)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180 W

Data on pool sizes and fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from 16 field study sites in a wide range of biomes were used to calibrate the model. Ranging from tundra to tropical forest, but excluding wetlands, these data are collectively known as the"TEM data set". Because these NPP data already existed as a collection, but were previously not widely available in electronic form, they have been made available through the ORNL DAAC as a service to the ecosystem modelling community. The spreadsheet and text versions of the table below have been compiled from the appendix to McGuire et al. (1992). See this reference for further details of sources of the data. Mean annual values of carbon in vegetation (CV), nitrogen in vegetation (NV), carbon in soil (CS), nitrogen in soil (NS), and inorganic nitrogen in soil (NAV), are in g/m2 of either carbon or nitrogen. Values of gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), nitrogen uptake by vegetation (NUPTAKE), saturation response of NPP to nitrogen fertilization (NPPSAT), and the annual amount of nitrogen mobilized for production via recycling (NMOBIL) are in g/m2/yr. McGuire et al. (1992) assume that NPP = carbon in litter production = carbon in heterotrophic respiration and that NUPTAKE = nitrogen in litter production = net nitrogen mineralization (NETNMIN) during calibration of the TEM model.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:12:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:12:00Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.149.11/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.149.11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10047</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Sites in USA, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, South Africa, Puerto Rico, and India.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-148.25 W

These increases are expected to result in global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, and may directly affect terrestrial ecosystems. Our understanding of the contemporary fluxes of these gases between the land and atmosphere is incomplete. There are large regions of the earth for which we have very little information on trace gas fluxes. Furthermore, for no region do we fully understand how global change, including land-use change, will affect gas fluxes.The United States Trace Gas Network(TRAGNET) is meant to accomplish the following two goals: Document contemporary fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O between regionally important ecosystems and the atmosphere Determine the factors controlling these fluxes and improve our ability to predict future fluxes in response to ecosystem and climate change.Part of this research is supported by the National Science Foundation.

grasshoppers, effects of grasshoppers on plant competition, and the effects of
plant species and biomass on the ability of grasshoppers to coexist.  The
plots were set up within the E026 fenced exclosure.  The plots are 60cm x
60cm.  They are enclosed by a cage which is 1.2m high.  The 240 plots were
seeded with monocultures and pairwise combinations of two grasses,
Schizachyrium scoparium, Poa pratensis, and a legume Lespedeza
capitata.  To each plant monoculture and species combination, two
grasshopper species were added at high density according to four treatments:
each grasshopper species by itself (2 treatments), both species together, and
no grasshoppers (empty cage).  Introduced grasshoppers were allowed to decline
to an "equilibrium" density, as determined by counting all grasshoppers in
cages every 5 days. After grasshoppers reached "equilibrium", vegetation was
sampled by clipping a 50cm x 5cm strip.  Soil samples were taken 5 times
during the summer to determine the effect of grasshoppers on available soil
nitrogen.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file

The data were collected in the 1960s and early 1970s and compiled into a single data set at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to facilitate comparisons involving the diverse woodland ecosystems. The data set was originally published in DeAngelis et al. (1981) and was extracted from that reference to be presented here. Representatives of almost every kind of forest ecosystem are present in the data set (Burgess, 1981). A hierarchical scheme was used to assign a forest type to each site based on the climate, life-form, behavior, and status features of the site. Included are sites of the following types, with the number of each type in parentheses: Tropical (26), Mediterranean (3), Temperate (55), and Boreal (33). With respect to life-form, 72 sites were dominated by broad-leaved species and 45 were needle-leaved. There were 65 deciduous stands and 52 evergreen. Finally 89 sites consisted of natural forest and 28 were managed. Overall, the sites were classified as mediterranean broad-leaved evergreen (1), mediterranean broad-leaved deciduous (2), tropical broad-leaved evergreen (4), tropical broad-leaved deciduous (4), tropical broad-leaved deciduous plantation (18), temperate broad-leaved evergreen (1), temperate needle-leaved deciduous plantation (1), temperate needle-leaved evergreen (7), temperate needle-leaved evergreen plantation (2), temperate broad-leaved evergreen plantation (2), temperate broad-leaved deciduous (43), boreal needle-leaved evergreen (27), and boreal needle-leaved evergreen plantation (5). As published, the data for each site were organized into three general parts. The first part identified the investigator(s), selected citations, years of the study, forest type, soil and geology types, and principal plant types. The second part consisted of general site description data, including edaphic characteristics, average meteorological conditions, and basic descriptive and quantitative data on the vegetation. In the last part, data for up to 38 biomass compartments are presented. Tables present the measured amounts and increments in these compartments, as well as the fluxes between them.

Disclaimers: The projects submitting data to the Woodlands Data Set were diverse, both internationally and in the scope and emphasis of their research. Because of this, the data did not always conform easily to the uniform format in which it is presented here. According to the compilers (DeAngelis et al. 1981); "Repeated communications with members of various projects were often employed before deciding on appropriate values. We have tried to follow faithfully the wishes of the projects in this regard." The meteorological and climatological measurements in the 'general site descriptions' in some cases represent values averaged over many years, and in other cases are values only for the years during which biomass measurements were made. In some cases the meteorological measurements were made directly at the site, while in other cases they were made at nearby stations. Lack of precise and generally agreed upon definitions is evident with respect to some quantities. Because of the variety of data forms submitted, with different compartmentalizations of the soil layers, values of the various soil compartments are not always consistent from site to site, Occasionally discrepancies occur between values which are listed as 'sums' of two or more compartments and the actual values in those compartments. The same holds true for net annual productivity; the value given for this is not always equal to the sum of fluxes and increments (see definitions above): Often, the reason for this is that the researchers have used their own insight to take into consideration other factors such as consumption, which could not be directly measured and, therefore, were not given in the biomass data. Rigorous comparisons among sites are complicated because of the above data constraints and because for each site there many be additional highly pertinent facts which could not be included in the data summaries. Those users of the data wishing to pursue similar analyses may find it useful to consult the literature publications relevant to each site, which are cited in the general site descriptions.</dc:description><dc:contributor>R.

Lieth, Dr. G. Esser and others. Much of this work was carried out at the University of Osnabrueck, Germany. More than 700 single point estimates of NPP or biomass were extracted from the scientific literature, each with a geographical reference (latitude/longitude). The literature cited dates from 1869 to 1982, with the majority of references from the 1960s and 1970s. Although this data set has not been updated since the 1980s, it represents a wealth of information for use in model development and validation. In the early 1970s, a subset of these NPP data was used by Lieth, Esser and co-workers to develop and test a series of statistical-correlative models of NPP as a function of mean annual temperature and precipitation. The later versions of these models included modifications for soil, seasonality, agriculture, and other human influences ("Osnabrýck Biosphere Mode,""High Resolution Biosphere Model," etc.). Most of the 720 unique NPP records (632, or 88 percent) have been matched to a bibliography of 356 references from the primary literature. The original form of this bibliography contained many more references than records, including multiple sources for the same author and study, as well as additional references to data on standing biomass, soils, and so forth. Since this is a useful resource in its own right, an edited and corrected compilation of these 858 references is available here with the cross-references to the NPP records highlighted. Of the 720 unique NPP records, about two-thirds have above-ground NPP estimates that range between 1 and 8530 g/m2/year (dry matter) -- or 2923 g/m2/year, excluding doubtful values, wetlands, and crops/pastures and other likely managed systems. Total NPP, for which more than half of the sites have estimates, ranges from 3 to 9320 g/m2/year (dry matter) -- or 3580 g/m2/year, excluding doubtful values, wetlands, and crops/pastures and other likely managed systems. Each record includes a site identifier, latitude, longitude, author, country, NPP estimates, vegetation type, and other variables. The vegetation-type field begins with a generalized biome type (including tundra, forest, Mediterranean, savanna, grassland, desert, wetland, and a number of managed vegetation types) and is followed by more specific vegetation terminology derived from the original data. Caution is advised in using these biome/vegetation types because they were not defined consistently within the original data set and nearly 200 sites lack any vegetation designation. To achieve completeness in a single synthesis file, a single NPP value (NPP_C) is included for each site that represents the sum of above-ground (ANPP) and below-ground (BNPP) components, expressed in grams of carbon per square meter per year (g C/m2/year). Where BNPP was not reported, it was assumed to be equal to ANPP. A ratio of 0.475 was used to convert dry biomass weight to carbon content. Total NPP was estimated as TNPP (where available), or as the sum of ANPP and BNPP (or from ANPP x 2, if BNPP was not estimated), and then converted to g C/m2/year.</dc:description><dc:contributor>H.Lieth</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>J.

Study sites included a coastal forest of western hemlock, sitka spruce, and red alder in a recent clear-cut; a mid-elevation forest of mature Douglas fir in the lower Cascades and a fertilized plot nearby; and an inland forest of ponderosa pine on the drier eastern slope of the Cascades with a fertilized forest nearby. Meteorological data and remotely sensed measurements of foliar nitrogen and leaf area index drove the model, while field measurements of seasonal changes in canopy leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance, foliage biochemistry, litterfall, and other components of plant production were used to validate the model. Each site was instrumented for continuous measurement of surface meteorology and monitored frequently for some aspects of carbon exchange, nutrient cycling rates, and water transport. The project was conducted from 1990 to 1991; the DAAC's data holdings include background data from 1989.
OTTER data sets include Canopy Chemistry, Meteorology, Field Sunphotometer, Airborne Sunphotometer, and Timber Measurements. They were transferred to the ORNL DAAC from the Ames Research Center node of the Pilot Land Data System (PLDS). Preceding info from http://daac.ornl.gov/OTTER/otter.html. Full details and access to other data from this project are available through the OTTER pages maintained by the ORNL DAAC. The OTTER NPP Data Set, described here, contains only the estimates of NPP and associated measurements from the OTTER transect that were made during the period 1989-1991.

soils prepared to have different availabilities of nitrogen.  It also
determines the results of competition experiments among various combinations
of these species as well as the differing feedback effects of each species on

The principal goals of the recovery plan review project were to compile an extensive detailed database on the content and characteristics of recovery plans, and to conduct quantitative analyses of these data to make useful recommendations for how the effectiveness and scientific rigor of recovery planning efforts could be improved. The project also provided a unique opportunity to undertake a large collaboration among graduate students and faculty at 19 different universities, and to facilitate communication between academic scientists and USFWS policy makers and resource managers.
The project began in September 1998 with development of a detailed questionnaire that was used as the primary tool for data collection. The data-collection Instrument (as the questionnaire was called) guided reviewers to consider and record data about a broad range of topics regarding the attributes and information contained in each recovery plan. General topics included: descriptive attributes of the plan and the species it covered; species biology; threats to the species; prescribed management actions; monitoring; plan administration, and; the criteria against which recovery would be measured. Recovery plans for 181 species were reviewed during the project. The sample represented about 20 percent of all recovery plans, and was stratified to include plans for different taxonomic groups (vertebrates, invertebrates and plants), revised and unrevised recovery plans, single-species and multi-species recovery plans, and plans approved over a range of years (1977 to 1998). After all plans had been reviewed and data compiled, two workshops were held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in Santa Barabara, CA. The workshops were attended by student and faculty representatives from each seminar group. The purpose of these workshops was to initiate analyses of the recovery plan database. This project successfully accomplished the most detailed and comprehensive review of endangered species recovery plans yet conducted, and produced a rich database of information on the content and characteristics of these planning documents. Analyses of the database have identified many positive aspects of recovery plans, and also suggested specific ways in which the recovery planning process could be improved. The database will continue to be a valuable resource for detailed quantitative information on recovery plans.

Twenty-four Class I boreal forest stands (complete NPP budgets) and 45 Class II stands (aboveground NPP - ANPP - budget only) were identified. The geographic distribution of the Class I stands was not uniform; 46 percent of the stands were from two studies in North America and only one stand was from the important larch forests of Eurasia. Total (above- and below-ground) net primary productivity (NPP) ranged from 52 to 868 gC/m2/yr and averaged 424 gC/m2/yr. ANPP was consistently larger for deciduous than evergreen boreal forests in each of the major boreal regions, especially for boreal forests in Alaska. Ratios of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) to total net primary productivity (BNPP:TNPP) were consistently larger for evergreen (0.36) than deciduous (0.19) boreal forests. NPP of different-aged stands in age sequence varied from 44 to 77 percent - a magnitude equal or greater to that of climatic factors or vegetation type. NPP and ANPP were positively correlated (r2 = 0.66 to 0.68) to mean annual aboveground increment for Class I stands and this empirical relationship explained 81 percent of the observed variation of ANPP for Class II stands. These robust relationships provide an approach for increasing the number and spatial coverage of boreal forest NPP data needed to evaluate NPP estimates from ecosystem models. Notable deficiencies of boreal forest NPP data were: ground layer vegetation and belowground NPP data, NPP data for boreal forest age sequences, and NPP data for boreal larch ecosystems in Eurasia.
