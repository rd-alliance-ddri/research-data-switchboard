Infaunal and epifaunal molluscs were hand-collected from within quadrats of known area from mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in fomalin, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, measured and counted (count data is reported separately). Length of each measurable individual was determined using calipers or small etched rulers under a stereomicroscope.  Species abundance and density data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-0705c1.

Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert.

Sites were chosen to include a range of mainland and barrier island locations. All sites were dominated by salt marsh plant species, primarily Spartina alterniflora. To provide a general indication of the salinity conditions prevailing at each site, I measured salinity of the nearest body of water with a refractometer on the date that the site was sampled. Plant richness was documented along a single 5.0m wide transect at each site.  Each transect began at the lower elevational limit of vegetation and continued perpendicular to the water’s edge to the shrub community at the upper marsh border. Plant presence was noted in a series of nested subplots within a 1.0m x 5.0m plot at each meter along the transect. The results posted here are sites, position, salinity, and the site pool, or species encountered at the site.

The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh). Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set.

Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.

Species abundance was determined by hand-collecting all the infaunal and epifaunal molluscs from within quadrats of known area in mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in ethanol, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species.

Crab abundance was determined by counting the number of crab holes within a 625 cm^2 quadrat and converting the counts to number per square meter.  Counts were made in the mid-marsh and creek bank zones (n = 4 per zone) at  GCE sites 1 through 10.  This method does not differentiate which species made a particular hole and therefore only estimates total crab abundance.  Plugged holes were excluded from the counts.  Mean density across all sites and zones was 122 m^-2 (+/- 149 s.d.).</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielSaucedo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HongyuGuo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HuyVu</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:28:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:28:27Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.308.12/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.308.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10506</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-0811, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.  Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied.

Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species.

The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter, Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin.</dc:description><dc:date>2004</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:28:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:28:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.5502120.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.5502120.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10518</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

I acknowledge that these data were gathered by Cedar Creek scientists because they had already perceived the importance of these data for a variety of scientific and societal issues.

Species abundance was determined by hand-collecting all the infaunal and epifaunal molluscs from within quadrats of known area in mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in ethanol, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species. Size distribution data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-0812a2.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielSaucedo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>CaitlinYeager</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HongyuGuo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HuyVu</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:12Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.314.12/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.314.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10523</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-0812a1, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh). Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KazimierzWieski</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HongyuGuo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>KristenAnstead</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ChristaPeterson</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.312.12/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.312.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10526</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set PLT-GCEM-0812a, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

Infaunal and epifaunal molluscs were hand-collected from within quadrats of known area from mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved in ethanol, measured and counted (count data is reported separately).

The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh). Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KazimierzWieski</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HongyuGuo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>NickScoville</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>KristenAnstead</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:33Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.319.11/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.319.11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10532</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set PLT-GCEM-1004a, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.  Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-81.493498 W

Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site.

Infaunal and epifaunal molluscs were hand-collected from within quadrats of known area from mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved in ethanol, measured and counted (count data is reported separately). Length of each measurable individual was determined using calipers or an ocular micrometer mounted in a stereomicroscope.  Species abundance and density data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-0812a1. Numbers of individuals of each species in the abundance data file may not correspond exactly to the numbers of individuals in the size data file because some individuals may not have been measureable.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielSaucedo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>CaitlinYeager</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HongyuGuo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HuyVu</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2009</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:29:48Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.315.12/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.315.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10538</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-0812a2, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.  Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.

Sites were chosen to include a range of mainland, barrier island, and back-barrier hammock island locations. All sites were dominated by salt marsh plant species, primarily Spartina alterniflora. To provide a general indication of the salinity conditions prevailing at each site, I measured salinity of the nearest body of water with a refractometer on the date that the site was sampled. Plant richness was documented along a single 5.0m wide transect at each site. Each transect began at the lower elevational limit of vegetation and continued perpendicular to the water’s edge to the shrub community at the upper marsh border. Plant presence was noted in a series of nested subplots within a 1.0m x 5.0m plot at each meter along the transect. The results posted here are sites, position, salinity, and the composition of the plant community in 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrats located at 1 m intervals along the transect. This data set is a companion to PLT-GCET-0608, which provides pooled data for sites in Georgia.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>StevenPennings</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2010</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.322.13/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.322.13</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10549</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set PLT-GCET-0802a, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

Crab abundance was determined by counting the number of crab holes within a 625 cm^2 quadrat and converting the counts to number per square meter. Counts were made in the mid-marsh and creek bank zones (n = 4 per zone) at  GCE sites 1 through 10. This method does not differentiate which species made a particular hole and therefore only estimates total crab abundance. Plugged holes were excluded from the counts.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>KristenAnstead</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:19Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.324.12/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.324.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10551</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-1011, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

The quadrats were established as permanent plots at GCE sampling sites in October 2000 by placing wooden stakes at random locations across two nominal zones at each site, designated based on marsh structure (creekbank and high marsh). Several new plots were also added in October 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009 and 2010 to replace those lost due to catastrophic wrack disturbance or creek bank erosion. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>HongyuGuo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>NickScoville</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>KristenAnstead</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JenniferBlake-Mahmud</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.325.12/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.325.12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10553</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set PLT-GCEM-1010a, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-81.493498 W

Species abundance was determined by hand-collecting all the infaunal and epifaunal molluscs from within quadrats of known area in mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in ethanol, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species. Size distribution data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-1010a2.</dc:description><dc:publisher>GCE-LTER</dc:publisher><dc:contributor>StevenPennings</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JacobShalack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DanielSaucedo</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>NickScoville</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>KristenAnstead</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:30:58Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.329.11/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-gce.329.11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10567</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Overall bounding box describing the geographic region within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER study domain represented in data set INV-GCEM-1010a1, based on the maximum geographic extents of all site polygons referenced in the data set</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA.  Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area.  Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA.  Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like "Sutherland Bluff", are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site.  Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA.  Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA.  Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound.  No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse.  A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity  and  genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.  Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA.  Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.  Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA.  Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island.  This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-81.493498 W

This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070).  The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger.  The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added.  Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%.  The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations.

	Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \&amp; K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June.  For further information, see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd3.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots.  Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70&lt;! (see E070)&gt;.

	Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture.  Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen.  At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals.

	The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species:  Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC).  Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989.  The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place.

	A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area.  The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource.  Light readings were taken above and below vegetation.  Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken.  A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.</dc:description><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:31:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:31:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.648955.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.648955.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10572</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Biological material from three levels in the ocean (POM, plankton, benthos) was collected to determine the natural abundance of d13C and d15N.  Isotope data were used to trace the advection of northward flowing organic material through the Bering Strait into the Chukchi and Bering Seas.  Isotope signatures also provided information about the trophic links between pelagic and benthic components of the shelf and slope within the study area.

Collections were made from USCG R/V Healy during two expeditions through the Bering, Chukchi, and eastern Beaufort Seas.  The first 6-week expedition occurred from 15 May to 23 June 2004 (Spring) and the second from 16 July to 26 August 2002 (Summer).</dc:description><dc:date>2006-10-16</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:31:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:31:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/schonberg.3.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>schonberg.3.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10574</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Northern Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-170.0000 W

in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e001/e001.html"&gt;E001&lt;/A&gt;, applied at the same time as in that experiment.  For a
description of fertilizer added to E052, see file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  There are four
levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4.

       Level 1: undisturbed
       Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with
the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches
       Level 3: 2 passes or  however many required to produce about
50% bare ground
       Level 4: 3 passes or  however many required to produce 100%
bare ground.  This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in  others.
In  addition,  all woody  vegetation  not destroyed by  tilling is cut at the base.

 Rototilling is applied in late April.

 Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total
of sixteen treatments.  There are four replicates of each of the sixteen
treatments.  In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance;
highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times.
Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design.  Each of the 104
plots is 5m x 5m.

 Measurements taken at E052 will include:  1) species abundances, 2) community
biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground
net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization.  For a list of
treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e052/treatment.html"&gt;trmte52&lt;/A&gt;.

 The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores.
Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a
depth of 50cm.  Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and
poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground.

 In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where
N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were
randomly selected for the competition experiment.  The above and belowground
effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three
competition treatments:  transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1)
with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all
above and belowground parts of neighbors present.  One transplant was grown in
the center of each subplot.  Competition treatments were applied to subplots
within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990.  Competition treatments were
replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four
combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance.  Thus, the 40 plots of
the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance
levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x
3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition
treatment.  A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted.  Competition
treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot.

 In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and
positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were
used:  Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis.
Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2)
no neighbors.  The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient
environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and
the species.  There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments,
one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at
17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2
competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2
environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.  Seedlings were
transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.</dc:description><dc:date>1991</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:31:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:31:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.648952.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.648952.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10579</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.
