Thus, it is essential to understand how photosynthetic production across diverse ecosystems is, or is not, limited by N and P. Via a large-scale meta-analysis of experimental enrichments, we show that P limitation is equally strong across these major habitats and that N and P limitation are equivalent within both terrestrial and freshwater systems. Furthermore, simultaneous N and P enrichment produces strongly positive synergistic responses in all three environments. Thus, contrary to some prevailing paradigms, freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems are surprisingly similar in terms of N and P limitation.</dc:description><dc:contributor>DanielGruner</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>MattBracken</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ElsaCleland</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>StanHarpole</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HelmutHillebrand</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JacquelineNgai</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>EricSeabloom</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JonathanShurin</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JenniferSmith</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-10-01</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:09Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.347.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.347.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10285</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Meta-analysis of global data from seven continents.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180.0000

It continues measurements of groundwater levels that were initiated in by Frank Day in July 1990 (dataset VCR99066) and by Mark Brinson in October 1997 (dataset VCR05130). Refer to these datasets for previous measurements. The groundwater measurements use the same wells and locations, but differ in sensor technology and frequency of measurement.In August 2007, a system of wirelessly-connected data loggers designed by Thomas Williams was installed with help from Arthur Schwarzschild, Chris Buck, John Hayward and John Porter.  </dc:description><dc:publisher>Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research ProjectDepartment of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, 291 McCormick Road, PO Box 400123CharlottesvilleVA22904-4123USA434-924-7761434-982-2137http://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:18Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-vcr.177.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-vcr.177.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10289</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>North Hog Island (chronosequence) - North Hog Island (chronosequence)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Frank Day Well Location R2 - Frank Day Well Location R2</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Frank Day Well Location R3 - Frank Day Well Location R3</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Frank Day Well Location R4 - Frank Day Well Location R4</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Frank Day Well Location S2 - Frank Day Well Location S2</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Frank Day Well Location S3 - Frank Day Well Location S3</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Frank Day Well Location S4 - Frank Day Well Location S4</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island - Mark Brinson Well on Hog Island</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-75.657464 W

The dataset also includes information on the depth of many of the marsh and upland creeks leading into the bays.Elevations are in meters from mean-high water.Â Pixels are 10x10 meters on a side andÂ  coordinates are UTM WGS84, Zone 18.Â Gomez 2008 (see network links) stated "The tidal range at Gargathy Neck was determined and used to obtain the relationship between NAVD88 and MHW. The tidal range was estimated by taking an average of 5 different stations close to Gargathy Neck. Tidal ranges at stations located in Gargathy inlet, Chincoteague, Metompkin, Wachapreague and Wallops Islandâ€™s (www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/station-retrieve.shtml?type=bench+mark+data+sheets) were used to compute an average tidal range at Gargathy Neck. The tidal range at Gargathy Neck was determined to be 1.04 m + 0.18 m.Next, the relationship between NAVD88 and MHW was determined for Wallops Island and two stations at Chincoteague (www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/stationretrieve. shtml?type=bench+mark+data+sheets). About 40% of the tidal range was above NAVD88 datum and about 60% of the tidal range was below NAVD 88 datum.Based on these distributions around NAVD 88 datum, mean high water at Gargathy Neck, was determined 0.43 m above NAVD 88 and mean low water is 0.64 m below NAVD88 (Figure 9). The relationship between NAVD 88 datum and mean high water was used to adjust the bathymetric data to mean high water level."Here is the datum information from NOAA for one of the stations used.

Original data were collected in several regions/countries including Mexico (Veracruz, Chiapas, Soconusco), Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, and Nicaragua. Data were collected in several different projects by the co-owners of the data, but were generally collected between 1993-2006.  Bird data come exclusively from 10min 25m radius point count observations.  Tree data are species or mophospecies data from coffee or forest plots, and usually include complete enumeration of all trees in the plot.  Ant data were collected with variable methods depending on project, but include pitfalls, Winkler traps, tuna baiting, and visual searches.  Most projects also included data about the vegetation characteristics in their study sites including canopy cover, tree heights, shade strata, numbers of epiphytes, etc.  These project datasets were complied with the extent of conducting a meta-analysis to examine the overall trends in biodiversity decline across coffee systems varying in management intensity.</dc:description><dc:contributor>IvettePerfecto</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>IngeArmbrecht</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>GuadalupeWilliams-Linera</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ThomasDietsch</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>RobertoReynoso-Santos</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DarciAndresen</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>CesarTejeda-Cruz</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>RussellGreenberg</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>LorenaSoto-Pinto</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>WayneArendt</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Jose ManuelZolotoff</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>JorgeValenzuela</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>PeterBichier</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>CalebGordon</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-08-24</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:56Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.338.11/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.338.11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10308</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Mesoamerica and South America:  Mexico (Chiapas, Veracruz, and Soconusco), Guatemala (Polochic Valley), Nicaragua (Mombacho), Colombia (Apia, Risaralda), Peru (Apurimac Valley and San Francisco)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>97.8167 W

Here we synthesize global data on 17 threats and 14 marine ecosystems to produce a global, 1km2 resolution map of human impacts specific to each marine ecosystem.  We found that none of the ocean is unaffected by humans but that a relatively small fraction is heavily impacted, and that results vary greatly by region and ecosystem type.  This research is the first such global assessment, providing important guidelines for where conservation action and threat mitigation is most critical to meet global management and conservation goals.</dc:description><dc:contributor>ShaunWalbridge</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ColinEbert</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-06-15</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:20:59Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.334.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.334.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10310</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Global coverage at 1km2 resolution</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180.0000 W

(1995) developed a model representing the change that occurs in ecosystem state (or habitat type) along the shorezone, from the forest -&gt; high marsh -&gt; low marsh -&gt; mud flat, in response to the increased inundation caused by rising sea-level. They suggested that a seaward shift in ecosystem state is largely dependent on local slope and sediment supply. The states are associated with the dominant vegetation found within each. The most seaward (lowest in elevation) state is the mud flat. It is frequently inundated by tide and typically supports algal species. The next landward state is the mineral low marsh; it is dominated by Spartina alterniflora and is typically flooded at high tide. Sediments here may be largely mineral in origin. The next landward state is the high marsh; it may be dominated by S. patens, Distichlis spicata, and Juncus roemerianus. It is occasionally inundated by high tides and the soil is usually organic. The transition zone between the high marsh and the forest is typically dominated by Iva frutescens, Baccharis hamifolia, and Juniperus virginiana. It is only inundated during severe storm surges. The forest may be dominated by either pines or hardwoods and is again flooded with sea water only by storm surges. Goals: The goal of this long-term project is to evaluate how sea-level rise affects marsh evolution and ecosystem state change. Seventeen sites along Virginia's eastern shore have been selected to study marsh evolution on both the mainland and the barrier islands. These sites will be available for long-term seasonal to annual observations. Some sites will also be available for experimentation and short-term studies. The initial project is to establish initial site characteristics.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research ProjectDepartment of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, 291 McCormick Road, PO Box 400123CharlottesvilleVA22904-4123USA434-924-7761434-982-2137http://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:21:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:21:13Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-vcr.169.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-vcr.169.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10317</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Upper Phillips Creek Inundation experiment 2 - Upper Phillips Creek Inundation experiment 2</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-75.83495378494263 W

Details of initial manipulation may be found in: Tolley, P.M. and R.R. Christian. 1999. Effects of increased inundation and wrack deposition on a high salt marsh plant community.

North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields  and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek.   
     The North Inlet LTER site is located on the eastern shore of the Atlantic 
     Ocean, in a small tidal estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.A.   
     Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are latitude 79 degrees 10 minutes
     and longitude 33 degrees 11 minutes.  Zooplankton collections were made at
     two locations in Town Creek, the major tidal creek in the North Inlet
     estuary.  The DD site is located near the inlet mouth 10 m off the 
     southern shore of Town Creek at a small drainage very near the former 
     site of the Town Creek platform.  The boat was anchored, bow into the
     ebbing tidal current, and the paired weighted zooplankton nets lowered 
     to the bottom.  Tows were taken shortly after mid-ebb (2-hours prior to 
     low tide) when tidal velocities were swiftest, often exceeding 
     0.5 m/sec-1.  Water depth averaged 4 m.  The BB site is located
     approximately 2 km inshore from the inlet in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth
     of Boze's Creek.  Tows, taken at mid-ebb, were fished at tidal velocities
     less than or equal to 0.5 m/sec-1.  Water depth averaged 4 m.

     The BB collection site is located in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of 
     Boze's Creek.  Town Creek is the main tidal creek in the North Inlet
     estuary and is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes.  The
     creek banks are covered by large clusters of the American oyster
     (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble, and intermittent muddy flats.  
     The BB zooplankton station average water depth at mid ebb is approximately
     4 m.  Tidal velocity averages 0.3 m/sec-1.  Water clarity varies with 
     water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration,
     and rainfall.  The creek bottom at this site is muddy clay covered by
     varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal matter.  The DD
     collection site is characterized by a high energy, sandy or heavily 
     scoured bottom habitat.  Mid ebb water velocities can exceed 1.0 
     m/sec-1, re-suspending large amounts of sand and debris.  Water clarity
     varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity,
     duration, and rainfall.  At both sites, Town Creek is a well-mixed, high
     salinity creek inundated by diurnal tides.  Rain input, primarily runoff,
     depresses salinities briefly depending on the duration and frequency.

Since the project's initiation, the National Institute of Environmental Studies of Japan has become a project partner. The plot is located in Pasoh Forest Reserve in lowland dipterocarp forest, a type of evergreen tropical moist forest. The area is aseasonal and has a flat terrain. The first census was completed in 1989, and four recencuses have been completed since then. This plot contains more than 800 species and approximately 340,000 trees. Many of the plot's species are commercially important and are the focus of intensive demographic study. Furthermore, analyses of the human uses of the Pasoh forest and economic valuations of forest resources based on Pasoh FDP data have been conducted.</dc:description><dc:contributor>AbdulRahman</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>PeterAshton</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-04-24</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:21:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:21:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.324.4/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.324.4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10336</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Pasoah is 50-ha 1000 x 500 m plot; the long axis lies east-west.

The Sinharaja Forest Dynamics Plot was founded in 1993 by the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Department of Forestry, and CTFS/Harvard University. The forests of Sri Lanka display relatively low diversity but very high endemism. For example, in the Sinharaja World Heritage Site, 70% of its 190 tree species are endemic. The Sinharaja Forest Dynamics Plot contains one-half of the species in the World Heritage Site's lowland rain forests and one-quarter of all of Sri Lanka's tree species. The forest demographic work at the plot complements ongoing silvicultural and economic studies of the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka Forest Department, Yale School of Forestry and the Environment, CTFS/Harvard University. Research issues at Sinharaja include silvicultural management for diverse forest products including hardwoods, forest restoration, and the biological stability of forests of low biological diversity.</dc:description><dc:contributor>NimalGunatilleke</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ShameemaEsufali</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-04-24</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.325.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.325.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10340</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Sinharaja Forest Dynamics Plot lies between 424 and 575 m above sea level.

The Mudumalai forest is seasonal semi-evergreen lowland forest, typical of the lowland dry teak forest of the Indian subcontinent. Mudumalai is much less diverse than the other Forest Dynamics Plots surveyed to date, with 76 species and about 26,000 stems. The forest is an open-canopy woodland with grass cover that is subject to nearly annual fires and to browsing by large herds of elephants. A major focus, with significance for forest management practices through much of India, is the impact of fire and elephants on forest regeneration. The plot is recensused every year, although diameter measurements are not taken during every census. Remeasurement censuses have occurred in 1992, 1996, and 2000.</dc:description><dc:contributor>RamanSukumar</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HebbalaluSathyanarayana Suresh</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HandanakereShivaramiah Dattaraja</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>RobertJohn</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Niranjan V.Joshi</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-04-18</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.320.5/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.320.5</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10341</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary abuts the northern flank of the Nilgiri mountain range in the Western Ghats and is contiguous with the protected areas of Bandipur and Wynaad.

The focus of research at this 3-hectare plot is how monsoon winds affect forests. The plot's location is ideal for such investigations because it covers areas that are directly exposed to and protected from monsoon winds. There are clear vegetation differences in these two areas. The forest that is exposed to wind is short and unstratified with high stem density and low per-stem species diversity. The leaves of these plant are small and thick, and litterfall is low. In contrast, in areas protected from the wind, the forest is taller and stratified with low stem density and high per-stem species richness. Leaves in this area are thinner and larger, and litterfall is high. The recent plot recensus (1997) has indicated that on a whole, growth and mortality rates, between and among species, differed between two areas exposed to different amounts of wind.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Chang-FuHsieh</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-04-23</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:14Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.322.4/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.322.4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10345</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Nanjenshan Forest Dynamics Plot is located in the Nanjenshan Nature Reserve at the southern end of Taiwan</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>120.8531 W

For a complete description of sources and the content of variables you should consult the Data Dictionary on the EcoTrends-Socioeconomic Catalog (http://coweeta.ecology.uga.edu/trends/catalog_trends_base2.php) since the data collection procedure and sources used where the same. Nichole Rosamilia compiled all the data for the airshed as well as EcoTrends in case you have any particular questions that are not addressed in the data catalog or below. A few points to note on the attached data:1) '-9999' indicates a null value - prior to a given county coming into existence there is no data so it is recorded as null; periodically, and typically for no recorded reason, no data will be recorded or available for a given county so again it is recorded as null.2) the units of measure on certain variables, e.g., CWAGE (commercial establishments), changes over time from dollars, to thousands of dollars, to millions of dollars. Nichole left the data as it appears in the original rather than modify it on entry. For the on-line version we run the data through a script to standardize the units of measure, but that happens later in our data processing.The approximate airshed for the VCR/LTER was based on translation (of the oxidized nitrogen airshed for Shenandoah National Park created by R. Dennis of the Atmospheric Sciences Modeling Division of ARL, NOAA and NERL USEPA. The original Shenandoah National Park airshed was digitized from a printed copy, then the centroid of the airshed polygon was moved to from the park to the Virginia Coast Reserve. This was then intersected with ESRI counties data to generate the list of needed counties. A copy of the shapefile and a PDF is included in the "vcrairshed.zip" file in the data directory.</dc:description><dc:publisher>Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research ProjectDepartment of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, 291 McCormick Road, PO Box 400123CharlottesvilleVA22904-4123USA434-924-7761434-982-2137http://www.vcrlter.virginia.edu</dc:publisher><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-vcr.150.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-vcr.150.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10350</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Airshed for the Virginia Coast Reserve - Airshed for the Virginia Coast Reserve</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-72.048438 W

The Doi Inthanon forest is in a typical monsoon climate, and, thus, the lower elevations contain deciduous forest while the areas above 1,500 meters (areas often covered in clouds) contain evergreen forests. Situated at 1,700 meters, the Doi Inthanon FDP typifies the montane evergreen forest, and acts as the Asian equivalent to the montane La Planada site in Colombia. There are approximately 120 tree species and 17,000 trees in the first three hectares analyzed from the Doi Inthanon FDP.</dc:description><dc:contributor>SarayudhBunyavejchewin</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-04-13</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:42Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.315.6/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.315.6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10357</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Doi Inthanon Forest Dynamics Plot is located in the montane forest of Doi Inthanon National Park, Chian Mai province, northern Thailand.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>98.4964 W

The isolated patch of forest in which the 2-ha plot is located provides an excellent opportunity to study the impacts of fragmentation and isolation on forest dynamics and demographics. Additionally, because approximately fifty percent of the forest's birds, mammals, and amphibians have been lost, the site allows researchers to investigate the affect of faunal loss on the forest. The plot's second census has shown that recruitment in species that have biotically dispersed seeds - seeds spread by animals - has been reduced. In addition to answering important biological questions, the Forest Dynamics Plot is also used by CTFS as a training site for researchers throughout the region and is located near the CTFS Asia Program headquarters.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Sing KongLee</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>James V.LaFrankie</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:44Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.314.6/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.314.6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10358</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The 2-ha Bukit Timah Forest Dynamics Plot, Established in 1993, lies within the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, located in the center of the small island state of Singapore.

The Pontificia Universidad Católica de Ecuador, the University of Aarhus in Denmark, and CTFS/STRI initiated a Forest Dynamics Plot along the Rio Tiputini in Yasuní, Napo Province in non-seasonal, old-growth lowland moist forest in 1996. Within one hectare at the Yasuní­ FDP, there are 644 species. Comparing this number with species counts in one hectare at other plots -- Panamanian plot has 168 species and plot on peninsular Malaysia has 497 species --the richness of this area becomes even more apparent. When the 50-ha plot is censused, we expect that there will be about 1,300 species in the plot. A socio-economic study on the local Waotani community was conducted near the site, and found that distance from large markets is inversely related to non-timber forest product use.</dc:description><dc:contributor>RenatoValencia</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HugoNavarrete</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>RichardCondit</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Robin B.Foster</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Jens-ChristianSvenning</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>ElseMagard</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>HenrikBalslev</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.313.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.313.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10359</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Yasuní Forest Dynamics Plot is located in mature terra firme forest in Yasuní national Park and Biosphere Reserve.

BioResources Development and Conservation Programme - Cameroon and CTFS/STRI initiated a Forest Dynamics Plot in Korup in 1996, in conjunction with a medical drug discovery and biodiversity conservation project of the International Cooperative Biodiversity Group. This project applies information learned about forest dynamics and demographics to the discovery and development of potential new medicines from rainforest plants, with a focus on finding cures to malaria, leishmaniasis, HIV, and various other diseases with tropical origin. Tree density in the Forest Dynamics Plot is very high, and often exceeds 7,500 trees per hectare. Such density is remarkable compared to the Panama FDP which has 4,880 trees/ha, the Peninsular Malaysian FDP which has 6,700 trees/ha, and the Ecuadorian FDP which has 6,000 trees/ha. The species diversity at Korup FDP compares favorably to other Forest Dynamics Plots around the world, with approximately 600 different species expected in the 50-ha plot. The plot's high species diversity bodes well for the drug discovery program at the plot, and the species demographics information obtained from recensuses will provide necessary information for sustainable harvest and conservation of medicinal plants.</dc:description><dc:contributor>George B.Chuyong</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DavidKenfack</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Duncan W.Thomas</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-03-27</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:22:54Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.312.6/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.312.6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10360</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Korup is a 50-ha 1000 x 500 m plot; its long axis lies north-south (magnetic north).</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>8.2883 W

Ehime and Kyoto Universities (Japan) are also close collaborators at the site. Lambir's mixed dipterocarp forest is characterized by high endemism, and with approximately 1,200 species found in the 52-ha plot contains possibly the richest diversity of tree species in the Old World. This high species count at the plot is partly due to the plot's location. The plot crosses an abrupt change in soil types that results in a more than 60% change of species composition within 50 meters.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Hua SengLee</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>SylvesterTan</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>TakuoYamakura</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>James V.LaFrankie</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>AkiraItoh</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>PeterAshton</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-04-18</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:02Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.318.3/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.318.3</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10364</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Lambir Hills National Park is in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo.

The plot crosses a steep soil moisture gradient, forming a transect between dry evergreen dipterocarp and deciduous forest. Evergreen dipterocarp forest is a critically endangered habitat in the region, and often becomes converted into deciduous forest through degradation and fire. The area's abundant large game, including elephants and tigers, depends on each forest type in different ways and during different seasons. Understanding the dynamic relationship between these evergreen and deciduous forests will be fundamental to the conservation of both the forests and their wildlife.</dc:description><dc:date>2007-04-13</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:05Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.316.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.316.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10366</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Huai Kha Khaeng (HKK) Wildlife Sanctuary is a 278,000-ha reserve in the western part of Thailand.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>99.2169 W

The resulting data was processed with GPS Pathfinder Office using differential correction. All data are in the UTM (zone 18) and the WGS-84 projection was used throughout.During the repeated surveys of Hog, Curtis was developing methodologies and conventions for surveying sometimes confusing high-tide lines.Each shapefile name contains the island and the date of the survey within 2003 in the form Rmmdd where mm is the month and dd is the day. For example Hog_R0717_05A.shp would be Hog Island, VA on July 17, 2003.The raw GPS position files are also included.

Instead of containing one large plot, Ituri Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) is a collection of four ten-hectare plots, two in Lenda and two in Edoro. All four plots are located in the Congo Basin in lowland moist forest with seasonal rainfall and very flat terrain. The plots were initiated in 1994 with support from the CTFS/STRI, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Centre de Formation et de Recherche en Conservation Forestiere (CEFRECOF), and focus on the dynamics of populations of mbau (Caesalpiniaceae Gilbertiodendron dewevrei), an abundant canopy tree that dominates substantial areas of the forest and sometimes can comprise from seventy to ninety percent of the canopy. Two of the 10-ha plots are in mixed evergreen forest (at Edoro) and two are in monodominant mbau stands (Lenda). Researchers are exploring the consequences of species dominance on overall forest diversity and the distribution of other tree species. Additionally, the Ituri FDP data is closely linked with ongoing wildlife studies at the site.</dc:description><dc:contributor>Jean-RemyMakana</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>Terese B.Hart</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>John A.Hart</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>RichardCondit</dc:contributor><dc:date>2007-03-26</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:25Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.311.4/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.311.4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10374</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Ituri Forest Dynamic Plots were established in 1994 in the 1,350,000-ha Okapi Faunal Reserve (OFR), Eastern Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, which extends from 1° to almost 3°  N latitude and from 28°  to almost 30° E longitude.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>28.0 W

&lt;p&gt;This project consists of two studies involving microbial biomass determination in soil samples taken from the Main Cropping System Experiment (KBS004): Chloroform Fumigation-Incubation; Soil Microbial Biomass C and N, and Epifluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis; Soil Microbial Biovolume and C. The data for both studies are generated from subsets of the same soil samples, collected from treatments 1 &amp;#8211; 8, CF, DF, and SF. See the descriptor (KBS004) for treatment descriptions. Samples are collected approximately monthly (during ice-free conditions) or annually (varies by year) from 5 sampling stations in each of 6 replicate plots per treatment; exceptions are treatment 8 (four reps), and treatments CF, DF, and SF (three reps each). For experiment descriptions, protocols, and data, see individual datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples were collected by K. Klingensmith in 1989 and by S. Halstead in other years.  D. Harris performed lab analysis, data entry, data analysis, and data submission.  Original data files not available; contact the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTER&lt;/span&gt; data manager with questions.  The data currently available was derived from web-based files which were last reviewed by D. Harris on 10-01-1997 and may be available from archives.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:contributor>MichaelKlug</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DavidHarris</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:23:41Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-kbs.1.8/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-kbs.1.8</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10382</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>1989-04-24 to 1996-05-07</dc:coverage></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
