variation in abiotic and biotic aspects of the environment.  These data were collected along with branch demography and water potential measurements on several perennial life forms, including tree: Juniperus monosperma and Pinus edulis, shrub: Larrea tridentata, and grass species: Oryzopsis hymenoides and Sporobolus contractus.  These plants are being monitored at three sites which differ in elevation and topography as well as edaphic and annual precipitation characteristics.  The sites represent optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular species and permit specific hypotheses to be tested (e.g., relative impact of wet vs.  dry years on C3 [Oryzopsis] vs. C4 [Sporobolus] grasses).  Demographic measurements are made biannually, after the 'wet' (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons.  For tree and shrub species, estimates of growth and reproduction are based on branch demography.  Ten replicate branch tips each of 10-20 individuals per species per site are monitored.  For Juniperus, Pinus and Larrea, vegetative growth of branch as well as reproduction are monitored.  Additional measurements include needle length for Pinus and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for Larrea . For Oryzopsis and Sporobolus, which are both bunch grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction are monitored for 100 individuals per species per site.</dc:description><dc:contributor>TheresaNewberry</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>DavidKeller</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>AletheaBanar</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>RupalShah</dc:contributor><dc:date>1989</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:13:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:13:24Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.02589.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-sev.02589.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10085</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Goat Draw - this site is located in a small canyon that drains the Los Pinos to the east and is covered by pinyon/juniper woodland with occasional Quercus turbinella, Yucca spp., and Opuntia spp.  This small canyon drains into the main channel that is known as Goat Draw. This site contains two study sites, each with 49 labeled trees.  The tagged and measured trees are distributed, roughly equally, on the slopes on either side of the small canyon. Sepultura Flats - This area slopes down to the south from the north rim of Sepultura Canyon.  Juniper woodland near the rim grades into blue/black grama grasslands mixed with a few woody species such as snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) as one moves down the slope.The measured trees are on the trim of Sepultura Canyon and on the rocky slopes at the east edge of Sepultura Flats.  This study site was discontinued in 1990 and all tags were removed from the trees.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>W

Nearly five thousand separate time series are available here. In addition to all the population counts, there are taxonomic details of over 1400 species. The type of data contained in the GPDD varies enormously, from annual counts of mammals or birds at individual sampling sites, to weekly counts of zooplankton and other marine fauna. 
The project commenced in October 1994, following discussions on ways in which the collaborating partners could make a practical and enduring contribution to research into population dynamics. A small team was assembled and, with assistance and advice from numerous interested parties we decided to construct the database using the popular Microsoft Access platform. After an initial design phase, the major task has been that of locating, extracting, entering and validating the data in all the various tables. Now, nearly 5000 individual datasets have been entered onto the GPDD. 
The Global Population Dynamics Database comprises six Tables of data and information. The tables are linked to each other as shown in the diagram shown at http://cpbnts1.bio.ic.ac.uk/gpdd/Structur.htm. Referential integrity is maintained through record ID numbers which are held, along with other information in the Main Table. It's structure obeys all the rules of a standard relational database.</dc:description><dc:contributor>RobAnderson</dc:contributor><dc:contributor>EllenBazeley-White</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:13:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:13:52Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.167.14/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.167.14</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10100</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Worldwide.</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-180 W

The synthesis originated from a workshop, Litter Quality and Decomposition under Elevated CO2, held in Capri, Italy, September 1998, under the auspices of Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems project (GCTE) and the European COST network. Data on litter chemistry and decomposition of plant tissue grown in elevated and ambient carbon dioxide concentrations were gathered from participants of that workshop and from other published and pre-publication sources. The litter chemistry database comprised observations of naturally senesced leaves of herbaceous and woody plants exposed to elevated carbon dioxide (typically 600-700 ppm) in the field or in field chambers in the United States, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Data from plants grown in growth chambers with artificial lighting were excluded because of the possible artifacts of unbalanced nutrition or abnormal senescence. Also excluded were data from non-senesecent green leaves. The measures of litter chemistry were nitrogen concentration (mg/g) and lignin concentration (mg/g), with the number of replications and standard deviations included when available. The decomposition database included a wide range of plant tissue from different types of carbon dioxide-enrichment experiments. The measure of decomposition was percentage of initial mass lost over the course of the decomposition trial, which varied in duration.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:14:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:14:06Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/stan.3.1/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>stan.3.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10108</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>USA</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-170.375 W

in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e001/e001.html"&gt;E001&lt;/A&gt;, applied at the same time as in that experiment.  For a
description of fertilizer added to E052, see file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  There are four
levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4.

       Level 1: undisturbed
       Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with
the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches
       Level 3: 2 passes or  however many required to produce about
50% bare ground
       Level 4: 3 passes or  however many required to produce 100%
bare ground.  This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in  others.
In  addition,  all woody  vegetation  not destroyed by  tilling is cut at the base.

 Rototilling is applied in late April.

 Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total
of sixteen treatments.  There are four replicates of each of the sixteen
treatments.  In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance;
highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times.
Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design.  Each of the 104
plots is 5m x 5m.

 Measurements taken at E052 will include:  1) species abundances, 2) community
biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground
net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization.  For a list of
treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e052/treatment.html"&gt;trmte52&lt;/A&gt;.

 The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores.
Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a
depth of 50cm.  Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and
poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground.

 In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where
N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were
randomly selected for the competition experiment.  The above and belowground
effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three
competition treatments:  transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1)
with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all
above and belowground parts of neighbors present.  One transplant was grown in
the center of each subplot.  Competition treatments were applied to subplots
within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990.  Competition treatments were
replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four
combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance.  Thus, the 40 plots of
the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance
levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x
3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition
treatment.  A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted.  Competition
treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot.

 In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and
positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were
used:  Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis.
Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2)
no neighbors.  The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient
environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and
the species.  There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments,
one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at
17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2
competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2
environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.  Seedlings were
transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.</dc:description><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:14:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:14:15Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799152.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799152.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10111</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

As a part of setting up these experiments we established 136 plots which ranged in size from 9 to 25 square meters. These plots start out as either dominated by exotic annual or native perennial grasses. In addition to their initial composition, we subject these plots to a variety of treatments including seed additions, burning, nitrogen addition, watering, and pocket gopher exclusion. Data include annual sampling of plant cover (1 m2 pinframes), seed production and aboveground plant production (0.2 m2), as well as soil moisture and nutrient concentrations.</dc:description><dc:contributor>JimReichman</dc:contributor><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:14:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:14:47Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nceas.176.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>nceas.176.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10127</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara County, California</dc:coverage><dc:coverage>-120.733333333333 W

This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070).  The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger.  The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added.  Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%.  The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations.

	Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \&amp; K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June.  For further information, see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd3.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots.  Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70&lt;! (see E070)&gt;.

	Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture.  Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen.  At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals.

	The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species:  Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC).  Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989.  The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place.

	A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area.  The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource.  Light readings were taken above and below vegetation.  Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken.  A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.</dc:description><dc:date>1993</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:15:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21T15:15:03Z</dc:date><dc:date>2011-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>dataset</dc:type><dc:format>text/plain</dc:format><dc:identifier>http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-cdr.799155.2/xml</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>knb-lter-cdr.799155.2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.10134</dc:identifier><dc:coverage>The Cedar Creek Natural History Area is located in Anoka and Isanti counties, approximately 30 miles north of Saint Paul, MN.

Annual plant growth above ground is annually sampled in more than 20 fields from 4 permanently marked 3m x 4m plots in each field. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. The fields included in this study are 4, 5, 10, 24, 26, 28, 35, 39, 41, 45, 53, 70, 72, 77 and the Lawrence strip that was abandoned in 1988.
