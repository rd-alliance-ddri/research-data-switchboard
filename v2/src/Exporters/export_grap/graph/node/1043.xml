Here, we report a male bias among EPO in a wild population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). This resulted from a decline in both the proportion of males and EPO over the laying order of eggs in the clutch. However, previous studies suggest that, unlike the decline in EPO with laying order, the relationship between offspring sex ratio and laying order is not consistent between years and populations in this species. Hence, we caution against treating the decline in proportion of males with laying order, and the resulting male bias among EPO, as support for the above hypothesis. Variable patterns of offspring sex and paternity over the laying order may explain inconsistent associations between offspring sex and paternity, between and within species.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.b6428/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52738","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52738","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24026349","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0616"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.b6428"}}
