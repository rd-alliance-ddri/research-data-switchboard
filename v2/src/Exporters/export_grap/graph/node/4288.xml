Mating with multiple partners may enhance this resistance by further increasing the genetic variation among offspring. We exposed Potamopyrgus antipodarum to the eggs of a sterilising, trematode parasite and tested whether this altered mating behaviour. We found that exposure to parasites increased the number of snail mating pairs and the total number of different mating partners for both males and females. Thus our results suggest that, in host populations under parasite-mediated selection, exposure to infective propagules increases the rate of mating and the number of mates.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.9c6q0/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.9c6q0/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62141","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62141","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.1091","PMID:24759366"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9c6q0"}}
