The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to nine, and median observed heterozygosity was 0.435.\nConclusions: This large number of polymorphic loci will enable researchers to quantify male fitness, patterns of multiple pa- ternity, selfing, and biparental inbreeding in large natural populations of this species. These markers will also permit detailed study of fine-scale patterns of genetic structure.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cr3g5v4f/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.39058","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.39058","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3732/ajb.1200180","PMID:23196400"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cr3g5v4f"}}
