Here, we use a phylogenetic approach across 160 species and 11,658 loci to show that allelic richness was on average 11% lower (p < 0.0001) in overharvested populations, even after accounting for the effects of body size, latitude, and other factors. Heterozygosity was 2% lower (p = 0.030). Simulations confirmed that these patterns are consistent with a recent bottleneck in abundant species and also showed that our analysis likely underestimates the loss of rare alleles by a factor of two or three. This evidence suggests that overharvest drives the decay of genetic diversity across a wide range of marine fishes. Such reductions of genetic diversity in some of the worldâ€™s most abundant species may lead to a long-term impact of fishing on their evolutionary potential, particularly if abundance remains low and diversity continues to decay.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.jt683/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.jt683/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.jt683/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.51661","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.51661","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/mec.12509","PMID:24372754"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.jt683"}}
