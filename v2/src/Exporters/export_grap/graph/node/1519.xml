Two new species are described, Evaniscus lansdownei Mullins, sp. n. from Colombia and Brazil and Evaniscus rafaeli Kawada, sp. n. from Brazil. Evaniscus sulcigenis Roman, syn. n., is synonymized under Evaniscus rufithorax Enderlein. An identification key to species of Evaniscus is provided. Thirty-five parsimony informative morphological characters are analyzed for six ingroup and four outgroup taxa. A topology resulting in a monophyletic Evaniscus is presented with Evaniscus tibialis and Evaniscus rafaeli as sister to the remaining Evaniscus species. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology and other relevant biomedical ontologies are employed to create semantic phenotype statements in Entity-Quality (EQ) format for species descriptions. This approach is an early effort to formalize species descriptions and to make descriptive data available to other domains.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2jd88/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42039","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42039","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23166458","doi:10.3897/zookeys.223.3572"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2jd88"}}
