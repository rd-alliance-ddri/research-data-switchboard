Six pedons were described at the following landscape positions:  summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope, toeslope, floodplain.  Samples were analyzed at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska. Analyses included:  particle size (including fractionation of sand, silt and clay); total N; dithionate-citrate extractable Fe, Mn and Al; CEC; bulk density; available H2O; sand, silt and clay mineralogy.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.28261","name":"GeneKelly","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.28261","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-sgs.10.1","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sgs.10.1/xml"]}}
