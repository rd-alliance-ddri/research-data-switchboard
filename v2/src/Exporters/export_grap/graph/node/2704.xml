We used molecularly identified cultures to study fungi inhabiting 50 intertidal and sea-floor logs along the North Norwegian coast. The aim was to explore the taxonomic and ecological diversity and to examine factors shaping the marine wood-inhabiting fungal communities. The 577 pure cultures analyzed clustered into 147 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 97 % ITS sequence similarity. Ascomycota dominated, but OTUs belonging to Basidiomycota, Mucoromycotina and Chytridiomycota were also isolated. Nine OTUs could not be assigned to any fungal phylum. Almost half of the OTUs were considered non-marine. The western and eastern part of the Norwegian Barents Sea coast hosted different communities. Geography, substratum and site level variables contributed to shaping these communities. We characterized a previously overlooked fungal community in a poorly studied area, discovered high diversity and report many taxa for the first time from the marine environment.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.qg82k/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg82k/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg82k/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.56931","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.56931","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1016/j.funeco.2013.12.002","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qg82k"}}
