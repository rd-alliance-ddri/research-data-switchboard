We combine a multilocus phylogeography (one mitochondrial protein coding gene, three nuclear introns and one major histocompatibility complex gene) with species distribution modelling (projected on current and Last Glacial Maximum climate layers). All genetic markers consistently show extensive genetic variation within and genetic depletion outside the Carpathians. The species distribution model suggests that most of the current range was unsuitable at the Last Glacial Maximum, but a small suitable area remained in the Carpathians. Triturus cristatus dramatically expanded its postglacial range, colonizing much of temperate Eurasia from a glacial refugium in the Carpathians. Within the Carpathians, T. cristatus persisted in multiple geographically discrete regions, providing further support for a Carpathian “refugia within refugia” scenario.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.s9v06/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.s9v06/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.s9v06/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.s9v06/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.72082","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.72082","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s9v06"}}
