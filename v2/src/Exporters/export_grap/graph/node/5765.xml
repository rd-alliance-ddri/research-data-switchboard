Due to their direct effect on traits such as metabolic and growth rates, mitonuclear interactions may also affect variation in behavioural types or personalities (i.e. behavioural variation that is consistent within individuals, but differs among individuals). However, this possibility is largely unexplored. We used mitonuclear introgression lines, where three mitochondrial genomes were introgressed into three nuclear genetic backgrounds, to disentangle genetic effects on behavioural variation in a seed beetle. We found within-individual consistency in a suit of activity-related behaviours, providing evidence for variation in personality. Composite measures of overall activity of individuals in behavioural assays were influenced by both nuclear genetic variation and by the interaction between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. More importantly, the degree of expression of behavioural and life-history phenotypes was correlated and mitonuclear genetic variation affected expression of these concerted phenotypes. These results show that mitonuclear genetic variation affects both behavioural and life-history traits and they provide novel insights into the maintenance of genetic variation in behaviour and personality.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qk27t/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.71472","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.71472","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qk27t"}}
