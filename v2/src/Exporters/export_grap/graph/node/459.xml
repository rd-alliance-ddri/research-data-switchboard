The first available diagnostic material is often an effusion and biochemical analysis of soluble markers may provide additional diagnostic information. This study aimed to establish a predictive model using biomarkers from pleural effusions, to allow early and accurate diagnosis. Patients and Methods: Effusions were collected prospectively from 190 consecutive patients at a regional referral centre. Hyaluronan, N-ERC/mesothelin, C-ERC/mesothelin, osteopontin, syndecan-1, syndecan-2, and thioredoxin were measured using ELISA and HPLC. A predictive model was generated and validated using a second prospective set of 375 effusions collected consecutively at a different referral centre. Results: Biochemical markers significantly associated with mesothelioma were hyaluronan (odds ratio, 95% CI: 8.82, 4.82–20.39), N-ERC/mesothelin (4.81, 3.19–7.93), CERC/mesothelin (3.58, 2.43–5.59) and syndecan-1 (1.34, 1.03–1.77). A two-step model using hyaluronan and N-ERC/mesothelin, and combining a threshold decision rule with logistic regression, yielded good discrimination with an area under the ROC curve of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97–1.00) in the model generation dataset and 0.83 (0.74–0.91) in the validation dataset, respectively. Conclusions: A two-step model using hyaluronan and N-ERC/mesothelin predicts mesothelioma with high specificity. This method can be performed on the first available effusion and could be a useful adjunct to the morphological diagnosis of mesothelioma.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.h122b/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.51953","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.51953","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072030","PMID:23991032"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.h122b"}}
