Here we show, by analysing Cytochorme Oxidase I sequences, from 241 samples across this range, that this taxon in fact comprises four deeply divergent clades corresponding to the Pacific-Western Australia, Chagos-Madagascar-South Africa, Gulf of Aden-Zanzibar- Madagascar, and Red Sea-Persian/Arabian Gulf-Kenya. On the basis of the fossil record of Stylophora, these four clades diverged from one another 51.5-29.6 Mya, i.e., long before the closure of the Tethyan connection between the tropical Indo-West Pacific and Atlantic in the early Miocene (16–24 Mya) and should be recognised as four distinct species. These findings have implications for comparative ecological and/or physiological studies carried out using Stylophora pistillata as a model species, and highlight the fact that phenotypic plasticity, thought to be common in scleractinian corals, can mask significant genetic variation.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.n2fb2/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.47049","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47049","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23519209","doi:10.1038/srep01520"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.n2fb2"}}
