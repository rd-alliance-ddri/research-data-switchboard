However, little is currently known about the behavioral mechanisms by which interactions with inbred individuals induce fitness costs in outbred individuals. Here, we study effects of inbreeding on the behavioral dynamics of biparental cooperation in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. To this end, we used a two-by-two factorial design, in which an inbred or outbred female was mated to an inbred or an outbred male and tested for effects on cooperation between male and female parents providing care for their joint offspring. We found no evidence that inbred parents provided less care than outbred parents. Nevertheless, partners of inbred parents increased the amount of care they provided, leading to overcompensation. Our study shows that inbreeding can have strong and complex effects on the behavioral dynamics of biparental cooperation, and that these effects are mediated mainly through changes in the partner's behavior. We suggest that similar effects of inbreeding on outbred individuals may extend to other social contexts, such as cooperative breeding and mating. 19 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j4923/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.69290","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.69290","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j4923"}}
