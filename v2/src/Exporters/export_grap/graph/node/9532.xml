We recorded the number of seedlings (less than 0.5 m tall) of all tree species on a 1 x 1 m resolution across six land use legacy sites (2 plowed, 2 pastured, 2 permanent woodlot) in summer 1996 to test several predictions about seedling abundance, diversity, and dispersion patterns, and their relationships to forest structure, microclimates, and soil resources.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.20912","name":["CharlesMcClaugherty","TimothySipe","JessicaRigelman","RachelClark","RichardBowden"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.20912","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-hfr.141.4","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-hfr.141.4/xml"]}}
