It has often been assumed theoretically that aside from dominance, selective parameters do not differ between cells of varying ploidy. Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, I compared the effect size of 20 adaptive mutations in haploids and homozygous diploids and found, surprisingly, that the same mutations often had a much larger effect in haploids than homozygous diploids. This empirical result demonstrates that it cannot be assumed that mutations will have the same effect in haploids and homozygous diploids.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42558","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42558","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23054913","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2012.0614"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.h51jg"}}
