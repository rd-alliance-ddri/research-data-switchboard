Wild boar (Sus scrofa scrofa) females have been reported to adopt this tactic. However, whether the magnitude of developmental plasticity within a litter depends on stochasticity in food resources has not been yet investigated. From long-term monitoring, we found that juvenile females produced similar-sized fetuses within a litter independent of food availability. By contrast, adult females adjusted their relative allocation to littermates to the amount of food resources, by providing a similar allocation to all littermates in years of poor food resources but producing highly diversified offspring phenotypes within a litter in years of abundant food resources. By minimizing sibling rivalry, such a plastic reproductive tactic allows adult wild boar females to maximize the number of littermates for a given breeding event.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8hf1c/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.51764","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.51764","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0419","PMID:23904566"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8hf1c"}}
