Six 400m transects were run two times in 1995, in late May\nand late September to monitor potential responses in \"cool season\" and\n\"warm season\" plants.  There are six sites, each of which is a one\nkilometer-squared box.  Line transects are laid out along the length\nof two parellel sides of each box.  However, in most years data is\nrecorded only for a 400m segment.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.29588","name":["TerriKoontz","ScottCollins","SethMunson","CalebHickman","KarenWetherill"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.29588","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.00402.1/xml","knb-lter-sev.00402.1"]}}
