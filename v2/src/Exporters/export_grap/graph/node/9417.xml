Measurements were collected using StowAway XTI Temperature Loggers (Onset Computer Corp. XTI32-05+37) beginning 2005-01-04.  The instrument depth was 011 meters, in an overall water depth of 020 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.21374","name":["PatrickDrake","MargaretMcManus","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.21374","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/HMS001_020MXTI011R00_20050104.50.5/xml","HMS001_020MXTI011R00_20050104.50.5"]}}
