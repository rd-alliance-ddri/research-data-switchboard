This study aimed to characterize relative proportions of the repetitive fraction of large, complex genomes in a non-model system. The monocotyledonous plant order Asparagales (onion, asparagus, agave) comprises some of the largest angiosperm genomes and represents variation in both genome size and structure (karyotype). Anonymous, low coverage, single-end Illumina data from eleven exemplar Asparagales taxa were assembled using a de novo method. Resulting contigs were annotated using a reference library of available monocot repetitive sequences. Mapping reads to contigs provided rough estimates of relative proportions of each type of transposon in the nuclear genome. The results were parsed into general repeat types and synthesized with genome size estimates and a phylogenetic context to describe the pattern of transposable element evolution among these lineages. The major finding is that while some lineages in Asparagales exhibit conservation in repeat proportions, there is generally wide variation in types and frequency of repeats. This approach is an appropriate first step in characterizing repeats in evolutionary lineages with a paucity of genomic resources.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.43g64/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49168","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49168","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1139/gen-2013-0042","PMID:24168669"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.43g64"}}
