In this study we characterized patterns of multiple mating and reproductive skew in a naturally hybridizing swordtail fish species, Xiphophorus birchmanni. We quantified multiple mating using microsatellite markers to genotype embryos from 43 females collected from two wild populations. We also used a suite of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to categorize females and their inferred mates as either parental X. birchmanni or as introgressed individuals, which carried alleles from a sister species, X. malinche. We found that parental and introgressed X. birchmanni females mated multiply with both parental and introgressed males. We found no difference in mating patterns or reproductive skew between parental and introgressed X. birchmanni females. However, non-introgressed X. birchmanni males mated more often with large, fecund females. These females also had the greatest levels of skew in fertilization success of males. Thus, our results show that X. birchmanni has a polygynandrous mating system and that introgression of X. malinche alleles has only subtle effects on mating patterns in this species.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.878p7/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.71029","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.71029","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.878p7"}}
