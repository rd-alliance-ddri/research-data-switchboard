The data have been collected as a part of the European research project IntraBioDiv, lead by Pierre Taberlet. For a complete list of members of the consortium see the included file \"Consortium.pdf\". The IntraBioDiv project was supported by the Commission of the European Union Sustainable Development, Global Change and Ecosystems Programme - GOCE-CT-2003-505376. We are grateful that the members of the IntraBioDiv consortium allowed us to use their data and make it available to the scientific community.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.33567","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.33567","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f3rk4/1"}}
