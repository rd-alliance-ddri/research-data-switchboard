At least one stage was positively correlated with both genetic and geographic distance between species. Postzygotic isolation was generally stronger and faster evolving than postmating prezygotic isolation. In addition, there was no evidence for mechanical isolation or for reproductive character displacement in floral traits that can influence pollinator isolation. In general, among the potential isolating stages examined here, postzygotic barriers appear to be more effective contributors to reducing gene flow, including between sympatric species.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.ht7d7441/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.37721","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37721","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22834759","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01607.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.ht7d7441"}}
