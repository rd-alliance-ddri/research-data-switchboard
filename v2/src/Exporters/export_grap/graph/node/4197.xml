Squared change parsimony with random taxon reshuffling and pairwise comparisons reveal that most compactness and size parameters exhibit both phylogenetic and ecological signals. A discriminant analysis produces several inference models, including a ternary model (aquatic, amphibious, terrestrial) that yield the correct lifestyle in 88% of the cases. These models are used to infer the lifestyle of three extinct Permian temnospondyls: Eryops megacephalus, Acheloma dunni, and Trimerorhachis insignis.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.qd734/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.qd734/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.qd734/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.qd734/4"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.46637","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.46637","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/bij.12066","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qd734"}}
