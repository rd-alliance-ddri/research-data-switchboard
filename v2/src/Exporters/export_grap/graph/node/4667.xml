This detection may be confounded by effects due to the environment experienced by organisms prior to the test. We tested whether such confounding effects occur, using spider-mite selection lines on two novel hosts and one ancestral host, after 15 generations of selection. Mites were either sampled directly from the selection lines, or subjected to a common juvenile or to a common maternal environment, mimicking the most frequent environmental manipulations. These environments strongly affected all life-history traits. Moreover, the detection of adaptation and of correlated responses on the ancestral host was inconsistent among environments in almost 20% of the cases. Indeed, we did not detect responses unambiguously for any life-history trait. This inconsistency was due to differential environmental effects on lines from different selection regimes. Therefore the detection of adaptation requires a careful control of these environmental effects.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1kv04/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.34859","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.34859","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21955226","doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02388.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1kv04"}}
