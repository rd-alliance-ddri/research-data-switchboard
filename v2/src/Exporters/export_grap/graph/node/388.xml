An unusual example involves diplostigmaty, the possession of spatially and temporally distinct stigmas in Sebaea (Gentianaceae). Here, the single pistil within a flower has an apical stigma, as occurs in most flowering plants, but also a secondary stigma that occurs mid-way down the style, which is physically discrete and receptive several days after the apical stigma. We examined the function of diplostigmaty in S. aurea, an insect-pollinated species of the western Cape of South Africa. Floral manipulations and measurements of fertility and mating patterns provided evidence that basal stigmas function to enable autonomous delayed self-pollination, without limiting opportunities for outcrossing, and thus avoiding the costs of seed discounting. We suggest that delayed selfing serves as a mechanism of reproductive assurance in populations with low plant density. The possession of dimorphic stigma function provides a novel example of a flexible mixed mating strategy in plants that is responsive to changing demographic conditions.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8391t/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52073","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52073","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23945209","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0495"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8391t"}}
