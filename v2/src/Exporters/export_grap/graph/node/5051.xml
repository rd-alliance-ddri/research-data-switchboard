In the present study, we suggest that a simple mechanism, i.e., many-to-one mapping from internal states onto syllables, may underlie the emergence of apparent complex syllable sequences that have higher-order history dependencies. We analyzed the songs of Bengalese finches and of their wild ancestor, the white-rumped munia (Lonchura striata), whose songs are more stereotypical and simpler compared to those of Bengalese finches. The many-to-one mapping mechanism sufficiently accounted for the differences in the complexity of song syllable sequences of these two strains.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.6pt8g/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.6pt8g/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.55676","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.55676","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0842","PMID:24284561"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6pt8g"}}
