To address sex-based aspects of population structure, I evaluated sex ratios, co-occurrence of the sexes, correlations of abundance of the sexes, and dispersion of individuals of each sex for each of 34 host-ectoparasite associations from Paraguayan bats. Of the 34 host-ectoparasite associations, 23 exhibited positive co-occurrence, 27 exhibited positive correlation of abundances, 4 exhibited male sex bias, 1 exhibited female sex bias, 27 had clumped distributions of males, and 26 had clumped distributions of females. No associations exhibited negative co-occurrence, negative correlation of abundance, or hyper-dispersed males or females. There was no evidence for sexual segregation, sex-based niche partitioning, or intrasexual selection in any host-ectoparasite association. Previously proposed mechanisms (e.g. pre-partum sex bias, local mate competition, or mortality from host grooming) fail to explain observed patterns of sex bias. For ectoparasites of hosts that occupy permanent roost sites, sex-specific behaviour related to reproduction may make females more susceptible to off-host predation and less likely to be present in samples from bats captured away from the roost.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.ch2pq65h/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.ch2pq65h/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.ch2pq65h/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.ch2pq65h/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.ch2pq65h/5"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.38896","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38896","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.01924.x","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.ch2pq65h"}}
