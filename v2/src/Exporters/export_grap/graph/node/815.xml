However, sexual antagonism alone is not sufficient to maintain variation indefinitely. Selection of rare forms within the sexes can help to conserve genotypic diversity. We combined theoretical models and a field experiment with Myodes glareolus to show that negative frequency-dependent selection on male dominance maintains variation in sexually antagonistic alleles. In our experiment, high-dominance male bank voles were found to have low-fecundity sisters, and vice versa. These results show that investigations of sexually antagonistic traits should take into account the effects of social interactions on the interplay between ecology and evolution, and that investigations of genetic variation should not be conducted solely under laboratory conditions.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6m0f6870/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35869","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35869","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22096197","doi:10.1126/science.1208708"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6m0f6870"}}
