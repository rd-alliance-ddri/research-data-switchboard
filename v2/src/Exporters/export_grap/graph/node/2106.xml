One hypothesis is the unsuccessful hunt hypothesis, where carnivores leave an area after an unsuccessful hunt but continue hunting in the same area after a successful hunt. The second hypothesis is the patch disturbance hypothesis, where carnivores depart the area after a successful hunt because of behavioral responses of prey to predator presence. We used GPS-collars to monitor the movements of African lions (Panthera leo) and identified their kill sites to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Lions moved to a different area (>5 km) after 87 percent of the kills, which supports the patch disturbance hypothesis for patch departure behavior of large mammalian carnivores.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8861/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.8861/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8861","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8861","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1086/660824","PMID:21750389"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8861"}}
