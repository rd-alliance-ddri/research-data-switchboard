Disruptive coloration is a seemingly well-known camouflage mechanism proposed to function by breaking up an objectâ€™s salient features (such as their characteristic outline), rendering objects more difficult to recognise. However, while a wide range of animals are thought to evade detection using disruptive patterns, there is no direct experimental evidence that disruptive coloration impairs recognition. Using humans searching for computer-generated moth targets, we demonstrate that the number of edge-intersecting patches on a target reduces the likelihood of it being detected, even at the expense of reduced background matching. Crucially, eye-tracking data show that targets with more edge-intersecting patches were looked at for longer periods prior to attack, and passed-over more frequently during search tasks. We therefore show directly that edge patches enhance survivorship by impairing recognition, confirming that disruptive coloration is a distinct camouflage strategy, not simply an artefact of background matching.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fc109/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.55002","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.55002","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0501","PMID:24152693"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fc109"}}
