Having previously reported individual innovative tool use and manufacture by a Goffin cockatoo, we used the innovator (Figaro, a male) as a demonstrator to investigate social transmission. Twelve Goffins saw either demonstrations by Figaro, or ‘ghost’ controls where tools and/or food were manipulated using magnets. Subjects observing demonstrations showed greater tool-related performance than ghost controls, with all three males in this group (but not the three females) acquiring tool-using competence. Two of these three males further acquired tool-manufacturing competence. As the actions of successful observers differed from those of the demonstrator, result emulation rather than high-fidelity imitation is the most plausible transmission mechanism.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5hk2h/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.63192","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.63192","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25185997","doi:10.1098/rspb.2014.0972"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5hk2h"}}
