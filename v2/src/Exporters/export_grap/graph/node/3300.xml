Although a preference for physically fitter males is therefore predicted, the relationship between attractiveness and performance has rarely been quantified. Here, I test for such a relationship in humans and ask whether variation in (endurance) performance is associated with variation in facial attractiveness within elite professional cyclists that finished the 2012 Tour de France. I show that riders that performed better were more attractive, and that this preference was strongest in women not using a hormonal contraceptive. Thereby, I show that, within this preselected but relatively homogeneous sample of the male population, facial attractiveness signals endurance performance. Provided that there is a relationship between performance-mediated attractiveness and reproductive success, this suggests that human endurance capacity has been subject to sexual selection in our evolutionary past.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.v77j2/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58337","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58337","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24501269","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0966"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.v77j2"}}
