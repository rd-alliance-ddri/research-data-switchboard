Science 339(6127): 1611-1615.","description":"Using historic data sets, we quantified the degree to which global change over 120 years disrupted plant-pollinator interactions in a temperate forest understory community in Illinois, USA. We found degradation of interaction network structure and function and extirpation of 50% of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches, nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of pollination services have declined through time. The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.rp321/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.rp321/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.rp321/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.48292","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.48292","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23449999","doi:10.1126/science.1232728"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rp321"}}
