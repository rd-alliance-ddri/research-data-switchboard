Because contagious communication in primates serves to assess conspecific social awareness, we investigated whether instigators of jump–yip bouts adjusted their behaviour relative to the response of conspecifics recruited to display bouts. Increased responsiveness of neighbouring town members resulted in bout initiators devoting a significantly greater proportion of time to active foraging. Contagious jump–yips thus function to assess neighbours’ alertness, soliciting social information to assess effective conspecific group size in real time and reveal active probing of conspecific awareness consistent with theory of mind in these group-living rodents.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.g76t8/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.57343","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.57343","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.2153","PMID:24403324"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.g76t8"}}
