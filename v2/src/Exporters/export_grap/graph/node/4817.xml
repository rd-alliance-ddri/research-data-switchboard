Here we estimate net diversification rates for samples of sexual and asexual rotifers using phylogenetic reconstructions from sequence data of one mtDNA locus, cytochrome oxidase c subunit I. All four clades of bdelloid rotifers, obligate asexuals, had higher number of species per clade and significantly higher accumulation of diversification events towards the root of the trees than the four clades of their sexual relatives, the monogonont rotifers. Such differences were robust to confounding effects of number of analysed sequences, haplotype diversity, overall genetic divergence or age of the clades. Our results support the idea that differences in diversification rates could thus be ascribed to different mechanisms of speciation, with ecological speciation as the most plausible mechanism for asexual organisms.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36861","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36861","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1007/s11692-012-9161-z","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.67kq8346"}}
