This conclusion is strongly supported by reproductive behavior and morphological characters. Thus, we recognize the genus Fritziana Mello-Leitão for the three species in southeastern Brazil and Flectonotus Miranda-Ribeiro for the two species in northern South America.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qq877/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.34147","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.34147","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qq877"}}
