There is now growing support for such trade-offs in wild vertebrates, but these exclusively come from females. Here, we test this prediction in male red deer (Cervus elaphus) using detailed longitudinal data collected over a 40-year field study. We show that males which had larger harems and thereby allocated more resources to reproduction during early adulthood experienced higher rates of senescence in both harem size and rut duration. Males that carried antlers with more points during early life did not show more pronounced declines in reproductive traits in later life. Overall, we demonstrate that sexual competition shapes male reproductive senescence in wild red deer populations and provide rare empirical support for the disposable soma theory of ageing in males of polygynous vertebrate species.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.617bk/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68278","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68278","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25122226","doi:10.1098/rspb.2014.0792"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.617bk"}}
