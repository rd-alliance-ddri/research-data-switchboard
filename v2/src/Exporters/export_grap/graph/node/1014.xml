However, it is currently unclear how such protection is transferred, since in contrast to mothers, fathers do not directly provide offspring with a large amount of substances. In addition to sperm, male flour beetles transfer seminal fluids to females during copulation. Depending on whether paternal trans-generational immune priming is mediated by sperm or seminal fluids, it is expected to either affect only the genetic offspring of a male, or also their half-sibs that are sired by another male. We therefore conducted a double-mating experiment and found that only the genetic offspring of an immune primed male show enhanced survival upon bacterial challenge, while phenoloxidase activity, an important insect immune trait, and the expression of the immune receptor PGRP-LC were increased in all offspring. This indicates that information leading to enhanced survival upon pathogen exposure is transferred via sperm, and thus potentially constitute an epigenetic effect, whereas substances transferred with the seminal fluid could have an additional influence on offspring immune traits.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fs4hh/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.70152","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.70152","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fs4hh"}}
