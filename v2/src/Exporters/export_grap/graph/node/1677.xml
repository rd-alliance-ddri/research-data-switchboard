To do so we used restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing of four individuals from each population. Through alignment of reads to the domestic sheep (Ovis aries) genome we discovered >83,000 SNPs, of which >38,000 are suitable for assays such as an Illumina SNP chip. These loci will allow for fine-mapping of loci associated with horn size, and examination of the consequences of the genetic rescue including mapping genes underling differences in life-history characteristics.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.4qk81/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.4qk81/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.4qk81/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.4qk81/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49850","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49850","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23875910","doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12142"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4qk81"}}
