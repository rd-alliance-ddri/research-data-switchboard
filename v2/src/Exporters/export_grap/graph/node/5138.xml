However, very recent interactions of populations with each other and the environment are expected to leave the most pronounced signature on rapidly evolving nuclear microsatellite loci. We analyzed landscape characteristics and microsatellite markers of P. leucopus populations along a transect from southern Ohio to northern Michigan, in order to evaluate hypotheses about the spatial distribution of genetic heterogeneity. Genetic diversity increased to the north and was best approximated by a single-variable model based on habitat availability within a 0.5-km radius of trapping sites. Interpopulation differentiation measured by clustering analysis was highly variable and not significantly related to latitude or habitat availability. Interpopulation differentiation measured as FST values and chord distance was correlated with the proportion of habitat intervening, but was best explained by agricultural distance and by latitude. The observed gradients in diversity and interpopulation differentiation were consistent with recent habitat availability being the major constraint on effective population size in this system, and contradicted the predictions of both the postglacial expansion and core-periphery hypotheses.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/9","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.56096","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.56096","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24448564","doi:10.1038/hdy.2013.140"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j272c"}}
