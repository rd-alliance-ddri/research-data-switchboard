Criteria used in these definitions often involve a subjectively defined cut-off value for proximity, orientation, and time (e.g. courtship, aggression and social interaction networks) and the same numerical values are applied to all of the treatment groups within an experiment. However, one universal definition of an interaction may not correctly identify interactions within groups which differ in life histories, study treatments, and/or genetic mutations. Here we present an automated method for determining the values of interaction criteria using a pre-defined rule-set rather than pre-defined values. We use this approach and show changing social behaviours in different manipulations of Drosophila melanogaster. We also show that chemosensory cues are an important modality of social spacing and interaction. This method will allow a more robust analysis of the properties of interacting groups, while helping us understand how specific groups regulate their social interaction space.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.71567","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.71567","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5nv17"}}
