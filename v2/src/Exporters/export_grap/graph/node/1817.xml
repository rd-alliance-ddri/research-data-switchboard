Here we tested for specificity in the interaction between parasitoids (Lysiphlebus fabarum) and aphid hosts (Aphis fabae) that are protected by a heritable defensive endosymbiont, the γ-proteobacterium Hamiltonella defensa. Previous studies reported a lack of genotype-specificity between unprotected aphids and parasitoids, but suggested that symbiont-conferred resistance might exhibit a higher degree of specificity. Indeed, in addition to ample variation in host resistance as well as parasitoid infectivity, we found a strong aphid clone-by-parasitoid line interaction on the rates of successful parasitism. This genotype-specificity appears to be mediated by H. defensa, highlighting the important role that endosymbionts can play in host-parasite coevolution.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f9180/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42130","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42130","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22998667","doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02608.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f9180"}}
