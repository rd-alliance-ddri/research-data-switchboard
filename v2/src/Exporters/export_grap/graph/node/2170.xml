What mediates this bias towards the eyes? One hypothesis is that primates possess a distinct neural module that is uniquely tuned for the eyes of others. An alternative explanation is that configural face processing drives fixations to the middle of peoples' faces, which is where the eyes happen to be located. We distinguish between these two accounts. Observers were presented with images of people, non-human creatures with eyes in the middle of their faces (`humanoids’) or creatures with eyes positioned elsewhere (`monsters’). There was a profound and significant bias towards looking early and often at the eyes of humans and humanoids and also, critically, at the eyes of monsters. These findings demonstrate that the eyes, and not the middle of the head, are being targeted by the oculomotor system.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4rk06/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42979","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42979","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23118434","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2012.0850"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4rk06"}}
