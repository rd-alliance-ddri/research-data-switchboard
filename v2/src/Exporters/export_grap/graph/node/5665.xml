They are the type species, T. mulu Zhang & Maddison sp. nov., as well as the species T. bijibijan Zhang & Maddison sp. nov., T. dik Zhang & Maddison sp. nov., T. kubah Zhang & Maddison sp. nov., T. selan Zhang & Maddison sp. nov., and T. selasi Zhang & Maddison sp. nov. The spiders are small and brown to black, living in leaf litter in the tropical forest. Phylogenetic analyses based on 28s and 16sND1 genes indicate that they are a distinctive group within the marpissoids. Diagnostic illustrations and photographs of living spiders are provided for all species.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.984fn/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.66737","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.66737","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.11646/zootaxa.3852.2.5","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.984fn"}}
