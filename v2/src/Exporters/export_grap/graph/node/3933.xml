Distribution range expansion of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) by means of artificial habitats in the north-eastern limits of its distribution range","description":"During 2005-2008, field observations were made on the distribution and habitat occupation by Podarcis muralis in the middle Bistrita river basin. Prior to our study, this lizard was known from only 5 localities in Romanian Moldavia (Bicaz, Cheile Bicazului, Lacu Ro≈üu, Gherman and Dodeni). Through the present paper the authors acknowledge the existence of 28 sites populated by P. muralis in Moldavia and propose a new model for the range expansion of the species in the area using man-made structures such as road and railway fences and road beds, benefiting from the mild climate provided by the Izvorul Muntelui barrier lake and forming insular populations to further colonize suitable habitats.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.46776","isReferencedBy":"http://www.fupress.net/index.php/ah/article/view/3421/2987","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1dr06"}}
