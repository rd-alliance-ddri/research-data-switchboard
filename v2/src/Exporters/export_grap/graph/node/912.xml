Using a combination of in vivo knockout and in vitro gain/loss of function approaches, we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling. Loss of cavin-3 increases Akt signaling at the expense of ERK, while gain of cavin-3 increases ERK signaling at the expense Akt. Cavin-3 facilitates signal transduction to ERK by anchoring caveolae, a lipid-raft specialization that contains an ERK activation module, to the membrane skeleton of the plasma membrane. Loss of cavin-3 reduces the number of caveolae, thereby separating this ERK activation module from signaling receptors. Loss of cavin-3 promotes Akt signaling through suppression of EGR1 and PTEN. The in vitro consequences of the loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), accelerated cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. The in vivo consequences of cavin-3 loss are increased lactate production and cachexia.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.4950k/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.4950k/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49657","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49657","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24069528","doi:10.7554/eLife.00905"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4950k"}}
