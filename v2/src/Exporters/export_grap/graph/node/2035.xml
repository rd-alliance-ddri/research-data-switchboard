Yet, despite a considerable body of research confirming that organisms can recognise positive relatives, little research has shown that organisms can recognise negative relatives. Here, we extend previous work on human phenotype matching by introducing a cue to negative relatedness: negative self-resembling faces, which differ from an average face in the opposite direction to the way an individual’s own face differs from the average. Participants made trustworthiness and attractiveness judgements of pairs of opposite-sex positive and negative self-resembling faces. Analyses revealed opposing effects of positive and negative self-resembling faces on trustworthiness and attractiveness judgements. This is the first clear evidence that humans are sensitive to negative relatedness cues, and suggests potential for the adaptive allocation of spiteful behaviour.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5b9b0/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.39607","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.39607","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22694177","doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02553.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5b9b0"}}
