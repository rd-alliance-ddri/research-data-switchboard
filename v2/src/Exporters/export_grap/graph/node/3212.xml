The increase in foliar P involved similar proportional increases in organic and inorganic P in two species and a disproportionately large increase in inorganic P in A. blackiana. 4) Nitrogen addition did not alter foliar N concentrations in any species, but did decrease N resorption proficiency in H. concinna. 5) A fourth species, the palm Oenocarpus mapora, demonstrated remarkably static foliar nutrient concentrations, responding only with a marginal decrease in P resorption proficiency under N plus P co-addition. 6) Synthesis: Collectively, these results suggest that adjustment of N:P ratios can be expected in eudicots exposed to elevated P, but foliar N appears to already be at optimal levels in these lowland rainforest tree species. The complexity of species-specific responses to altered nutrient availability highlights the difficulty in predicting future responses of tropical forest trees to a changing world.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.257b9/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.55169","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.55169","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/1365-2745.12190","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.257b9"}}
