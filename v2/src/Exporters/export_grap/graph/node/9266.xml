Soils were sampled at several sites of various stand ages (time since last fire) and soil drainage.  The soils were sampled in 2000, 2001, and 2006.  Data includes, but is not limited to percent carbon, percent nitrogen, 13C, 14C, bulk density, and soil texture/Von Post decomposition status.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.17072","name":["JenniferHarden","KristenManies"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.17072","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-bnz.336.7","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-bnz.336.7/xml"]}}
