The existence of a species complex, in the case of Adialytus ambiguus (Haliday), and the morphological variability in commonly used taxonomic characters has been discussed. In total, four valid species belonging to the genus Adialytus including Adialytus ambiguus (Haliday), Adialytus salicaphis (Fitch), Adialytus thelaxis (Starý) and Adialytus veronicaecola (Starý) have been identified and recorded from Iran. Also, we recognized two additional phenotypes: “Adialytus arvicola” (Starý) and “Adialytus cf. ambiguus” (Haliday). These phenotypes and Adialytus veronicaecola are newly recorded from Iran in association with Sipha and Aphis species, respectively. An illustrated key for identification of the species and two variable phenotypes is presented.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r/6"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42056","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42056","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3897/zookeys.221.3541","PMID:23129982"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fc57r"}}
