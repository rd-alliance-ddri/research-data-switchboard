Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. The epidemic histories of HIV-1 group M and non-pandemic group O were similar until ~1960, after which group M underwent an epidemiological transition and outpaced regional population growth. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.nn952/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.nn952/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.nn952/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.nn952/4"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68248","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68248","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25278604","doi:10.1126/science.1256739"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nn952"}}
