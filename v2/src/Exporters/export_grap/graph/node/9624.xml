One of the best methods of measuring soil moisture\non a continuous basis is Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR).  To this end\na network of TDR soil moisture sensors was installed at all\nmeteorological stations on Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.  At 3\nof the sites the sensors are measured on an hourly basis in\nconjunction with the meteorological variables At the other 4 sites the\nsensors are measured on a much less frequent basis - about every 2\nweeks.  Sensors were installed in pits in sets of 5. One sensor was\ninstalled vertically adjacent to the pit to measure the top 30 cm of\nsoil.  The other 4 were installed horizontally in the face of the pit\nat 5, 10, 20, 40 cm.  Pits were then backfilled.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.14227","name":["DougMoore","JamesGosz"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.14227","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-sev.07898.1","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sev.07898.1/xml"]}}
