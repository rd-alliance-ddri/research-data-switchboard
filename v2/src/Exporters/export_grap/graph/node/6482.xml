The gateway features a garli 2.0 web service that enables a user to quickly and easily submit thousands of maximum likelihood tree searches or bootstrap searches that are executed in parallel on distributed computing resources. The garli web service allows one to easily specify partitioned substitution models using a graphical interface, and it performs sophisticated post-processing of phylogenetic results. Although the garli web service has been used by the research community for over three years, here we formally announce the availability of the service, describe its capabilities, highlight new features and recent improvements, and provide details about how the grid system efficiently delivers high-quality phylogenetic results.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639/8"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62704","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62704","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1093/sysbio/syu031","PMID:24789072"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d7639"}}
