Kuntze) is the worldâ€™s most popular beverage crop. However, to date, no core collection has been selected from worldwide germplasm resources on the basis of genotype data. In this study, we analyzed 788 tea germplasm accessions using 23 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Our population structure analysis divided the germplasms into a Japanese group and an exotic group. The latter could be divided into var. sinensis and var. assamica. The genetic diversity was higher in germplasms from China, Taiwan, India, and Sri Lanka than in those from other countries, and low in germplasms from Japan. Using the number of SSR alleles as a measure of genetic diversity, we developed a core collection consisting of 192 accessions and three subcore collections with 96, 48, and 24 accessions. Although the results might be affected by marker-selection bias, the core 192 collection adequately covered the range of variation of the 788 accessions in floral morphology, and the chemical composition of first-flush leaves. These collections will be powerful tools for breeding and genetic research in tea.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5jn04/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.67709","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.67709","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1007/s11295-014-0779-0","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5jn04"}}
