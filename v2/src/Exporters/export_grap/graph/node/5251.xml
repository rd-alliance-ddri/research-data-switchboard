In most cases, organisms specialize onto habitats that fall into discrete categories, such as host species used by herbivores and parasites. Ecological specialization within a continuous habitat gradient is theoretically possible, but becomes less likely with increasing gene flow among clinal habitat types. Here, I show that habitat race formation is underway in a frog, Rana temporaria, along a continuous and spatially mosaic habitat gradient. Tadpoles from 23 populations raised in an outdoor mesocosm experiment showed adaptive phenotypic variation correlated with the predator density in their pond of origin. A survey of microsatellite markers in 48 populations found that neutral genetic divergence was enhanced between ponds with very different densities of predators. This represents a new example of habitat specialization along a continuous habitat gradient with no spatial autocorrelation in habitat.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f0824/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58381","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58381","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/jeb.12327","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f0824"}}
