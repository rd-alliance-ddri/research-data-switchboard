Here we present a new approach that we name ‘forensic genomics’, combining field surveys, toxin testing and genomic scans. Forensic genomics queries allele frequencies of surviving animals for signatures of agents causing mass mortality and, where genetic diversity is high, is uniquely suited to identify natural selection in action. As a proof of concept, we use this approach to investigate the causes of an invertebrate mass mortality event, and its genetic effects on an abalone population. Our results support that a harmful algal bloom producing a yessotoxin was a major causative agent to the event.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2qs35/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.59708","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.59708","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24736548","doi:10.1038/ncomms4652"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2qs35"}}
