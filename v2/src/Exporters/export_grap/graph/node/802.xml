Here, we have chronicled the dynamics of protein and mRNA expression levels across a minimally perturbed cell cycle in human myeloid leukemia cells using centrifugal elutriation combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA-Seq, avoiding artificial synchronization procedures. We identify myeloid-specific gene expression and variations in protein abundance, isoform expression and phosphorylation at different cell cycle stages. We dissect the relationship between protein and mRNA levels for both bulk gene expression and for over âˆ¼6000 genes individually across the cell cycle, revealing complex, gene-specific patterns. This data set, one of the deepest surveys to date of gene expression in human cells, is presented in an online, searchable database, the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics (http://www.peptracker.com/epd/).","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2r79q/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.57888","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.57888","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.7554/eLife.01630.001","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2r79q"}}
