Utilizing landmarks and semilandmarks, we have characterized internal and external shape variation in a monophyletic clade of Cenozoic New Zealand and Australian crassatellid bivalves, to test the contiguity in morphospace of species-level taxa and to quantitatively examine the \"Concept of Independent Entities\" of Yonge (1953). Thirteen species from two genera (Spissatella Finlay 1926 and Eucrassatella Iredale 1924) are investigated. Spissatella n. sp. C is confirmed as forming a contiguous group separate to S. trailli and S. clifdenensis. Shell outline and internal anatomy are found to covary in shape, refuting the \"Concept of Independent Entities\" in the study group.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cs1k4/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49232","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49232","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1666/12048","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cs1k4"}}
