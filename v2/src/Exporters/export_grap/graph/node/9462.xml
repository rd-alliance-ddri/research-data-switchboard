Measurements were collected using a StowAway XTI Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. XTI32-05+37) beginning 2009-06-30.  The instrument depth was 004 meters, in an overall water depth of 20 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.19614","name":["MargaretMcManus","OliviaCheriton","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.19614","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["HMS001_020MXTI004R00_20090630.50.1","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/HMS001_020MXTI004R00_20090630.50.1/xml"]}}
