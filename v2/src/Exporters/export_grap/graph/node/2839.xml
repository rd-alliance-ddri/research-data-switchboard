To identify functional translational readthrough, we estimated the readthrough propensity (RTP) of all stop codon contexts of the human genome by a new regression model in silico, identified a nucleotide consensus motif for high RTP by using this model, and analyzed all readthrough extensions in silico with a new predictor for peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1). Lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) showed the highest combined RTP and PTS1 probability. Experimentally we show that at least 1.6% of the total cellular LDHB getting targeted to the peroxisome by a conserved hidden PTS1. The readthrough-extended lactate dehydrogenase subunit LDHBx can also co-import LDHA, the other LDH subunit into peroxisomes. Peroxisomal LDH is conserved in mammals and likely contributes to redox equivalent regeneration in peroxisomes.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j2n18/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68937","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68937","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.7554/eLife.03640","PMID:25247702"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j2n18"}}
