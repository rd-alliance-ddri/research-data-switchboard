The diversity and biogeographic patterns differed substantially between the active and total bacterial communities. Although the composition of both, the total and active bacterial community was strongly correlated with environmental factors and weakly correlated with geographic distance, the active bacterial community displayed higher environmental sensitivity than the total community and particularly, a greater distance effect largely caused by the active assemblage from deep waters. The 16S rRNA versus rDNA relationships indicated that the active bacteria were low in relative abundance in the SCS. This might be due to a high competition between active bacterial taxa as indicated by our community network models. Based on these analyses, we speculate that high competition could cause some dispersal limitation of the active bacterial community resulting in a distinct distance-decay relationship. Altogether, our results indicated that the biogeographic distribution of bacteria in the SCS is the result of both environmental control and distance-decay.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c/7"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.61382","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.61382","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/mec.12739","PMID:24684298"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s8c2c"}}
