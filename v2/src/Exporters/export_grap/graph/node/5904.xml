It has been argued that oil spills may have important long-term consequences on marine organisms, but supporting evidence remains scarce. The European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) was strongly impacted at population level by the Prestige oil spill, the biggest spillage in the eastern North Atlantic. In this paper, we report on the long-term consequences on reproduction of this coastal seabird, using temporal and spatial replicated data (before–after–control–impact design). Our study revealed long-term reproductive impairment during at least the first 10 years since the Prestige oil spill. Annual reproductive success did not differ before the impact, but after the impact it was reduced by 45% in oiled colonies compared with unoiled ones. This is a rare documentation of long-term effects after a major oil spill, highlighting the need for long-term monitoring in order to assess the real impact of this type of disturbance on marine organisms.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nd764/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62210","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62210","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24789139","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.1041"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nd764"}}
