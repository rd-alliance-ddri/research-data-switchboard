This proximate–ultimate dynamic brings genetic variation in social environments to the forefront of evolutionary theory. However, the extent of this variation remains largely unknown. Here, we use a member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess how mate preferences are influenced by genetic variation in the social environment. We used full-sibling split-families as ‘treatment’ social environments, and reared focal females alongside each treatment family, describing the mate preferences of the focal females. With this method, we detected substantial genetic variation in social influence on mate preferences. The mate preferences of focal females varied according to the treatment families along with which they grew up. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the presence of such genetic variation in social influence on mate preferences, including potential contributions to the maintenance of genetic variation, the promotion of divergence, and the adaptive evolution of social effects on fitness-related traits.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nm021/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49095","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49095","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.0803","PMID:23698010"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nm021"}}
