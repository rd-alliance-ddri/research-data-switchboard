Multiplex PCR of microsatellites is a fast and cost-effective technique allowing high throughput genotyping. Here we present the procedure used to develop two multiplex kits (8-plexes) for European beech. We paid particular attention to quality control throughout all steps of the multiplex kits development (null allele detection, error rate measurements, linkage disequilibrium). Preliminary assays suggest that the multiplex kits amplify 16 loci largely devoid of null alleles and allow rapid and cost-effective genotyping of beech with low error rates. The two kits, which differ in their levels of polymorphism, most likely due to marker origin, were also informative in seven other beech species tested.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.pc8d30j2/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.pc8d30j2/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35498","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35498","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22145937","doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.03094.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pc8d30j2"}}
