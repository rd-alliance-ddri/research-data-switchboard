In their article, Mitton and Ferrenberg (2012) suggested that climate change resulted in an unprecedented generation between June and September (a summer generation) with a concomitant shift to two generations in one year (bivoltinism). Although summer generations are not uncommon in this species, completion of a 2nd generation across winter, between September and June, would be required for bivoltinism, a phenomenon not previously observed. Mitton and Ferrenberg (2012) showed that a summer generation can occur, but they failed to adequately track cohorts and provided no compelling evidence for bivoltinism. We demonstrate that a winter generation, and hence bivoltinism, would have been physiologically impossible at the high elevation site used in Mitton and Ferrenberg (2012) due to low thermal developmental thresholds. Mountain pine beetle is indeed being influenced by climate change. To address the challenges of future population outbreaks of this significant tree mortality agent, however, it is imperative to consider data describing evolved, thermally-dependent traits that serve to maintain seasonality.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qt2qb/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68384","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68384","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qt2qb"}}
