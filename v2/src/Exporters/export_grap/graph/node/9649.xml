Measurements were collected using StowAway Tidbit Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. TBI32-05+37) beginning 2006-12-30. Site temperature loggers are bolted down in a wire cage at various locations within each site. Mussel growth temperature loggers are bolted down in a wire cage at high, mid, or low positions within a mussel bed. Temperature is recorded at 10.0 minute intervals.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.27464","name":["PISCO OSU Lab Manager","BruceMenge","FrancisChan","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.27464","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["CARX00_XXXITBDXMMR01_20061230.50.2","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/CARX00_XXXITBDXMMR01_20061230.50.2/xml"]}}
