Although there has been substantial progress in the developing theory for Wolbachia–host interactions and in measuring the effects of Wolbachia on host fitness in the laboratory, there is a widely recognized need to quantify the effects of Wolbachia on the host fitness in the field. The wasp Anagrus sophiae, an egg parasitoid of planthoppers, carries a Wolbachia strain that induces parthenogenesis, but its effects on the fitness of its Anagrus host are unknown. We developed a method to estimate the realized lifetime reproductive success of female wasps by collecting them soon after they die naturally in the field, counting the number of eggs remaining in their ovaries and quantifying Wolbachia density in their body. We sampled from a highly infected A. sophiae population and found no evidence for Wolbachia virulence and possible evidence for positive effects of Wolbachia on realized reproductive success.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.3t30n/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.54113","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.54113","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/jeb.12264","PMID:24125079"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.3t30n"}}
