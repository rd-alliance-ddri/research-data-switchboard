To test the combined effects of ecological and evolutionary forces on host-pathogen systems, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of a plant (Plantago lanceolata)â€“fungal pathogen (Podosphaera plantaginis)relationship for 12 years in over 4000 host populations. Disease prevalence at the metapopulation level was low, with high annual pathogen extinction rates balanced by frequent (re-)colonizations. Highly connected host populations experienced less pathogen colonization and higher pathogen extinction rates than expected; a laboratory assay confirmed that this phenomenon was caused by higher levels of disease resistance in highly connected host populations.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.vf210/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.63522","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.63522","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1126/science.1253621","PMID:24926021"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.vf210"}}
