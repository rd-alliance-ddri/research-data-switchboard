Measurements were collected using an RDI 600 kHz Workhorse Sentinel ADCP beginning 2008-01-15.  The instrument depth was 015 meters, in an overall water depth of 15 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The instrument was programmed with a sampling interval of 2.0 minutes and a vertical resolution of 1 meter.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.18033","name":["LibeWashburn","ChrisGotschalk","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.18033","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["MORXXX_015ADCP015R00_20080115.50.5","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/MORXXX_015ADCP015R00_20080115.50.5/xml"]}}
