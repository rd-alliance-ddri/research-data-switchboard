We measured bizygomatic facial width vs. height - a trait known to predict aggressive behaviour in males - and assessed whether facial morphology could predict survival, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and social status. We found no difference in survival along the phenotypic gradient, however, wider-faced individuals had greater LRS, but achieved a lower military rank.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d5vh1/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.48843","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.48843","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0049","PMID:23658003"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d5vh1"}}
