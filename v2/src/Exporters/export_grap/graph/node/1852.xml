Nature Communications 5: 4306.","keywords":["Mass Spectrometry","Metabolomics"],"description":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a persistent intracellular pathogen intrinsically tolerant to most antibiotics. The specific factors which mediate this tolerance however remain incompletely defined. Here, we apply metabolomic profiling to discover a common set of metabolic changes associated with the activities of three clinically used TB drugs, isoniazid, rifampicin, and streptomycin. Despite targeting diverse cellular processes, all 3 drugs trigger activation of Mtb’s isocitrate lyases (ICLs), metabolic enzymes commonly assumed to be involved in replenishing of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates. We further show that ICL-deficient Mtb strains are significantly more susceptible than wild type Mtb to all three antibiotics and that this susceptibility can be chemically rescued when Mtb is co-incubated with an anti-oxidant. These results identify a previously undescribed role for Mtb’s ICLs in antioxidant defense as a mechanism of antibiotic tolerance.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.kd8cj/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.65208","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.65208","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1038/ncomms5306","PMID:24978671"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.kd8cj"}}
