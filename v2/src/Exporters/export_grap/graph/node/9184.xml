The first worksheet defines the data use policy. The second worksheet contains the data with column headings of family, binomial, average individual vessel size (A), vessel number (N), vessel composition (S = A/N), and vessel lumen fraction (F = AN), as well as log transformed values of these 4 variables. The third worksheet contains references for these data.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.1139","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1139","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1138/1"}}
