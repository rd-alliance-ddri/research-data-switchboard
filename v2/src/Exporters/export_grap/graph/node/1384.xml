Although exaggerated secondary sexual traits frequently exhibit interesting relationships with body size (allometries) and are expected to evolve rapidly in response to environmental variation, the way in which allometry might interact with latitude has not been addressed. We present data showing latitudinal variation in body size and weapon allometry for the New Zealand giraffe weevil (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis). Males display an extremely elongated rostrum used as a weapon during fights for access to females. Consistent with Bergmann’s rule, mean body size increased with latitude. More interestingly, weapon allometry also varied with latitude, such that lower latitude populations exhibited steeper allometric slopes between weapon and body size. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document a latitudinal cline in weapon allometry, and is therefore a novel contribution to the collective work on Bergmann’s rule and secondary sexual trait variation.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5nm01/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.71148","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.71148","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5nm01"}}
