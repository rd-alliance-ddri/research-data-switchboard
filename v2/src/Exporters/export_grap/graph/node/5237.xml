Such comparisons may provide important insight into the evolution of mate choice for honest signals. In particular, because females generally provide the majority of resources for initial offspring development, female displays may trade-off with fecundity, causing preference evolution to differ between the sexes. Recent theory suggests that adaptive male preferences for honest displays in females are possible under certain conditions and may result in preferences that are convex (i.e. stabilizing) in form. We compared sexual selection on a suite of contact pheromones arising from mutual mate choice using nine separate geographic populations of Drosophila serrata. We show that the convex selection is stronger on females than on males overall in these populations, and that convex selection is the predominate form of nonlinear selection on females but not males.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8633/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8633","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8633","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21361917","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01158.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8633"}}
