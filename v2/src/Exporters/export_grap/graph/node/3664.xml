In this article, we propose the Close Linkage versus Pleiotropism (CLIP) test, a fast, simple and powerful method to distinguish between these two situations. The CLIP test is based on the comparison of the square of the observed correlation between a combination of apparent effects at the marker level to the minimal value it can take under the pleiotropic assumption. A simulation study was performed to estimate the power and alpha risk of the CLIP test and compare it to a test that evaluated whether the confidence intervals of the two QTLs overlapped or not (CI test). On average, the CLIP test showed a higher power (68%) to detect close-linked QTLs than the CI test (43%) and a same alpha risk (4%).","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.m0584/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.m0584/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42546","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42546","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1038/hdy.2012.70","PMID:23250009"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.m0584"}}
