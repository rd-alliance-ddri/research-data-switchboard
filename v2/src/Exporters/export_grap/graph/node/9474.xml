Both of these metrics are measured from 0 (complete dissimilarity) to 1 (identity). I/D values that fall within the 95% C.I. (“in”) indicate models that are no more/less similar than random and are interpreted as evidence of niche conservatism. I/D values that fall above the 95% C.I. (“out, high”) and indicate statistical niche conservatism. I/D values that fall below the 95% C.I. (“out, low”) are interpreted as evidence of niche evolution.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53884","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53884","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sp4t0/9"}}
