Design: Prospective Cohort study. Setting: Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. Participants: 110 children (aged 1 month to 16 years). Intervention: Anthracycline (Doxorubicin and/or Daunorubicin). Outcome measurements: All children who received anthracycline as chemotherapy and three echocardiographic evaluations (baseline, one month and 1 year) between July 2010 and June 2012 were prospectively analyzed for cardiac dysfunction. Statistical analysis including systolic and diastolic functions at baseline, 1 month and 1 year were made by repeated measures analysis of variance (r-ANOVA). Results: Mean age was 74Â±44 months and 75 (68.2%) were males. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was seen in 70 (64%) patients. Doxorubicin alone was used in 59 (54%) and combination therapy was used in 35(32%). A cumulative dose of anthracycline <300mg/m2 was in 95 (86%). Fifteen (14%) children developed cardiac dysfunction within a month and 28(25%) children within a year. Of these 10/15 (66.6%) and 12/28 (42%) had isolated diastolic dysfunction respectively, while 5/15 (33.3%) and 16/28 (57%) had combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Seven (6.4%) patients expired due to severe cardiac dysfunction. 8/59 (13.5%) children receiving doxorubicin showed dysfunction mostly related to higher cumulative dose (p=<0.001). Cardiotoxicity was high where combination of doxorubicin and daunorubicin was used (p=0.004). Conclusion: Anthracycline induced cardiac dysfunction is high. Long term follow-up is essential in children received any dosage of anthracyclines because of its late manifestation.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cg849/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.56007","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.56007","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24259388","doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003663"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cg849"}}
