PLoS ONE 7(8): e42882.","description":"We report a method for Selective Depletion of abundant RNA (SDRNA) species from Human total RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, here demonstrating removal of ribosomal and mitochondrial transcripts from clinical FFPE tissue RNA archived up to 20 years. Importantly, SDRNA removes 98% of targeted RNAs while preserving relative abundance profiles of non-targeted RNAs, enabling routine whole transcriptome analysis of clinically valuable archival tissue specimens by Next-Generation Sequencing.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.k83b8/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.40653","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.40653","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22900061","doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0042882"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.k83b8"}}
