Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(6): 1066-1076.","description":"Chronic stress often affects growth and development negatively and these effects are often mediated via glucocorticoid hormones, which elevate during stress. We investigated latitudinal variation in corticosterone (CORT)-response to chronic predator stress in Rana temporaria tadpoles along a 1500 km latitudinal cline in Sweden tadpoles, in a laboratory experiment. We hypothesised that more time-constrained high-latitude populations have evolved a lower CORT-response to chronic stress to maintain higher growth under stressful conditions. Southern tadpoles had higher CORT-content in response to predators after one day of exposure, whereas there was no increase in CORT in the northern populations. Two weeks later there were no predator-induced CORT elevations. Artificially elevated CORT levels strongly decreased growth, development and survival in both northern and southern tadpoles. We suggest that the lower CORT-response in high-latitude populations can be connected with avoidance of CORT-mediated reduction in growth and development, but also discuss other possible explanations.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.tk553840/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.tk553840/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.tk553840/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.tk553840/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.tk553840/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.38958","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38958","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22587843","doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02493.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.tk553840"}}
