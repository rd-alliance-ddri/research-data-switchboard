Here we present a method useful for genotyping within the w Pip group. Primers were designed using a Tandem Repeat Finder program to amplify an intergenic, polymorphic site (pp-hC1A_5) of w Pip. The polymorphic site is located between genes that code for polynucleotide phosphorylase and a hypothetical protein (C1A_5). Comparison of these w Pip genomic regions from C. pipiens mosquitoes sampled in different geographic regions revealed deletions of fragments that proved useful in phyologenetic analysis.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8289/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8289","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8289","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02991.x","PMID:21676204"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8289"}}
