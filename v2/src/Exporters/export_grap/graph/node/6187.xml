Cacao is an important perennial crop of humid tropics. Cacao EST sequences as available in public domain were downloaded and made into contigs. A total of 769 contigs were  made using contigs assembly program pharp. Puative information of contigs were identified using NCBI and ExPASy tools  such as BlastX, tblastn.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.179","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1007/s12041-009-0030-1","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.179"}}
