GL is a fundamental piece of information for population ecologist as well as for measuring species threat status (e.g. in the IUCN Red List). Here we present a dataset including GL records for all extant mammal species (n=5426). We first reviewed all data on GL published in the IUCN Red List database. We then calculated a value for species with available reproductive parameters (reproductive life span and age at first reproduction). We assigned to missing-data species a mean GL value from congeneric or confamilial species (depending on data availability). Finally, for a few remaining species, we assigned mean GL values from species with similar body mass and belonging to the same order. Our work provides the first attempt to complete a database of GL for mammals; it will be an essential reference point for all conservation-related studies that need pragmatic information on species GL, such as population dynamics and applications of the IUCN Red List assessment.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gd0m3/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53416","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53416","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.3897/natureconservation.5.5734","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gd0m3"}}
