Science 341(6151): 1243-1246.","description":"The high-frequency wing beat of higher-order insects is driven by self-sustained oscillations of constantly activated flight muscles. However, it remains unknown whether its underlying mechanism is based on flight muscleâ€“specific features or on preexisting contractile functions. Here, we recorded x-ray diffraction movies, at a rate of 5000 frames per second, simultaneously from the two antagonistic flight muscles of bumblebees during wing beat. Signals that occurred at the right timing for triggering each wing-beat stroke were resolved in both muscles. The signals likely reflect stretch-induced myosin deformation, which would also enhance force in vertebrate muscles. The results suggest that insects use a refined preexisting force-enhancing mechanism for high-frequency wing beat, rather than developing a novel mechanism.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.bt51g/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.bt51g/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.bt51g/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.bt51g/4"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53053","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53053","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23970560","doi:10.1126/science.1237266"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.bt51g"}}
