This pattern can be explained by a model that combines allometry, life-history theory, and energetics. The key features are that female group size increases with increasing body size and that males have evolved under sexual selection to grow large enough to control these groups of females. The model predicts relationships among body size and female group size, male and female age at first breeding, death and growth rates, and energy allocation of males to produce body mass and weapons. Model predictions are well supported by data for these megaherbivores. The model suggests hypotheses for why some other sexually dimorphic taxa, such as primates and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions), do or do not conform to Rensh’s rule.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.17vs2d34/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35651","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35651","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22218307","doi:10.1086/663686"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.17vs2d34"}}
