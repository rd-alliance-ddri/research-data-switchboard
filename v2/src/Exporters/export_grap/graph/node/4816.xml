In this study, we sequenced transcriptomes for eleven Primulina species across the phylogeny of the genus using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 336 million clean reads were processed into 355,573 unigenes with a mean length of 1336 bp and an N50 value of 2191 bp after pooling and reassembling twelve individual pre-assembled unigene sets. Of these unigenes, 249,973 (70%) were successfully annotated and 256,601 (72%) were identified as coding sequences (CDSs). We identified a total of 38,279 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 367,123 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Marker validation assay revealed that 354 (27.3%) of the 1296 SSR and 795 (39.6%) of the 2008 SNP loci showed successful genotyping performance and exhibited expected polymorphism profiles. We screened 834 putative single-copy nuclear genes and proved their high effectiveness in phylogeny construction and estimation of ancestral population parameters. We identified a total of 85 candidate orthologs under positive selection for 46 of the 66 species pairs. This study provided an efficient application of RNA-seq in development of genomic resources for a group of “stone plants” from south China Karst regions, a biodiversity hotspot of the World. The assembled unigenes with annotations and the massive gene-associated molecular markers would help guide further molecular systematic, population genetic and ecological genomics studies in Primulina and its relatives.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/10","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/9","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s/5"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68348","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68348","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25243665","doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12333"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.h738s"}}
