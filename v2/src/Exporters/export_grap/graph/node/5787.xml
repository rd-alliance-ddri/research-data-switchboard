Manengouba in southwestern Cameroon. The new species is distinguished from other Cameroonian Arthroleptis by moderately larger body size; a darkened throat and posterior thigh, both with many white spots; and, in females, a fourth finger longer than the first and second fingers. This species corresponds to a Cameroonian taxon previously identified as Arthroleptis adolfifriederici but which has been long recognized as distinct. Multivariate morphometric analysis demonstrates that the new taxon is distinct from Arthroleptis variabilis, which occurs in the surrounding lowlands. Because of the general similarity of the new species to A. variabilis and its previous confusion with A. adolfifriederici, redescriptions of the latter two species are provided. This refinement of taxonomic knowledge will facilitate future study of cryptic or undescribed large Arthroleptis from western, central, and eastern Africa.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1963","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.3099/0006-9698-515.1.1","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1963"}}
