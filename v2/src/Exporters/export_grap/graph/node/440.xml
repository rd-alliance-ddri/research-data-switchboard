Six species of Ectyphus are recognised (E. abdominalis Bezzi, 1924, E. armipes Bezzi, 1924, E. capillatus Hesse, 1969, E. pinguis Gerstaecker, 1868, and E. pretoriensis Bezzi, 1924), of which one is newly described from Kenya, E. amboseli sp. n. Two species, E. bitaeniatus Hesse, 1969 and E. flavidorsalis Hesse, 1969, are newly synonymised with E. pinguis. The monotypic genus Parectyphus Hesse, 1972 and the male of its type species P. namibiensis Hesse, 1972 are re-described while the female is described for the first time. Comments on the distribution of all species within biodiversity hotspots are given. A dichotomous identification key to the genera and species of world Ectyphinae is provided and illustrated keys to the world Ectyphinae are made available online in both dichotomous and multi-access, matrix-based formats.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.41239","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3897/zookeys.73.840","PMID:21594051"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.99n02"}}
