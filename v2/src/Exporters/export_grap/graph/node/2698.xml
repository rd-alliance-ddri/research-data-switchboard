To do this, we develop a population genetic model that incorporates a fraction of neutral amino acid sites, mutational bias, and a probability distribution of selection coefficients against new nonsynonymous mutations. We confirm, by reanalyzing publicly available data sets, that the mitochondrial cyt-b gene shows a broad range of neutrality indices across mammalian taxa, and explore the biological factors that can explain this observation. We find that observed patterns of differences in the neutrality index, polymorphism and divergence are not caused by differences in mutational bias. They can, however, be explained by a combination of a small fraction of neutral amino acid sites, weak selection acting on most amino acid mutations, and differences in effective population size among taxa.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8bp5pp44/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.37948","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37948","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22834742","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01628.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8bp5pp44"}}
