Biology Letters 10(9): 20140623.","keywords":["fertilization","sexual selection","condition dependent","ejaculate quality"],"description":"The health benefits of diets containing rich sources of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) are well documented and include reductions in the risk of several diseases typical of Western societies. The dietary intake of n-3 LC-PUFA has also been linked to fertility, and there is abundant evidence that a range of ejaculate traits linked to fertility in humans, livestock and other animals depend on an adequate intake of n-3 LC-PUFA from dietary sources. However, relatively few studies have explored how n-3 LC-PUFA influence reproductive fitness, particularly in the context of sexual selection. Here, we show that experimental reduction in the level of n-3 LC-PUFA in the diet of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) depresses a male's share of paternity when sperm compete for fertilization, confirming that the currently observed trend for reduced n-3 LC-PUFA in western diets has important implications for individual reproductive fitness.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pv5tq/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.70229","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.70229","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25252837","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2014.0623"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pv5tq"}}
