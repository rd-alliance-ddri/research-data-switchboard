Science 336(6087): 1434-1438.","description":"Aboveground consumers are believed to affect ecosystem functioning by regulating the quantity and quality of plant-litter entering the soil. We uncover a novel pathway whereby terrestrial predators regulate ecosystem processes via indirect control over soil community function. Grasshopper herbivores stressed by spider predators have a higher body carbon-to-nitrogen ratio than grasshoppers raised without spiders. This change in elemental content does not slow grasshopper decomposition but perturbs belowground community function, decelerating subsequent decomposition of plant-litter. This legacy effect of predation on soil community function appears to be regulated by the amount of herbivore-protein entering soil.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2cm3h1q7/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.39019","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.39019","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22700928","doi:10.1126/science.1220097"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2cm3h1q7"}}
