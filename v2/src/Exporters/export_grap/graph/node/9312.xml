Measurements were collected using StowAway Tidbit Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. TBI32-05+37) beginning 2007-06-15. Site temperature loggers are bolted down in a wire cage at various locations within each site. Mussel growth temperature loggers are bolted down in a wire cage at high, mid, or low positions within a mussel bed.
