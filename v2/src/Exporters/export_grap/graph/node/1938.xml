Herein, we use novel molecular genetic methods to quantify larval Yellow Perch (YP) in predator stomachs in western Lake Erie to test the hypothesis that turbidity drives variation in larval predation. We characterize predator stomach content DNA to first identify YP DNA (single nucleotide polymorphism) then quantify larval YP predation (microsatellite allele counting) in two river plumes differing in turbidity. Our results showed elevated larval YP predation in the less turbid river plume, consistent with a top-down impact of turbidity on larval survival. Our analyses highlight novel ecological hypothesis testing using the power of innovative molecular genetic approaches.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.9b495/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.9b495/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.9b495/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.66637","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.66637","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25231387","doi:10.1111/mec.12927"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9b495"}}
