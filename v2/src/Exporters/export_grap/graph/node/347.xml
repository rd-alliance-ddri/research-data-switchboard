Here we present verified data for 3627 individuals of 27 taxa in the form of a life history table containing summarized species values for variables relating to ancestry, reproduction, longevity, and body mass, as well as the two raw data files containing direct and calculated variables from which this summary table is built.  Large sample sizes, longitudinal data that in many cases span an animal’s entire life, exact dates of events, and large numbers of individuals from closely related yet biologically diverse primate taxa make these datasets unique.  This single source for verified raw data and systematically compiled species values, particularly in combination with the availability of associated biological samples and the current live colony for research, will support future studies from an enormous spectrum of disciplines.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.fj974/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.fj974/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.fj974/9"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.63129","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.63129","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1038/sdata.2014.19","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fj974"}}
