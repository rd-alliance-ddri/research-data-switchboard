We assessed the feasibility of association mapping CWD genetic risk factors in wild white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) using a panel of bovine microsatellite markers from three homologous deer linkage groups predicted to contain candidate genes. These markers had a low cross-species amplification rate (27.9%) and showed weak linkage disequilibrium (<1 cM). Markers near the prion protein and the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) genes were suggestively associated with CWD status in white-tailed deer (P = 0.006) and mule deer (P = 0.02), respectively. This is the first time an association between the NF1 region and CWD has been reported.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.qf2vm/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.qf2vm/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.qf2vm/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.qf2vm/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.41311","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.41311","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/eva.12003","PMID:23467626"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qf2vm"}}
