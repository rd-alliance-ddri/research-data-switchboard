H. Barrow Field Station, Hiram Township, Portage County, Ohio. We used PIT tags (AVID) to permanently mark turtles. We trap turtles using a combination of hoop-net traps (baited with sardines in oil) and basking traps. All turtles were measured (carapace and plastron length) and many were weighed. The vast majority of turtles were midland painted turtles, with several snapping turtles trapped. This is a long-term study.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.21820","name":["Organization of Biological Field Stations","WalterMeshaka","(OH) JH Barrow Field Station","SamuelMarshall"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.21820","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/obfs2.397.1/xml","obfs2.397.1"]}}
