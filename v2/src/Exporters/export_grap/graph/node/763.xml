However, the causal mechanisms underlying inbreeding depression in general and the often increased susceptibility to stress in particular are not well understood. We here test whether inbreeding interferes with the heat-shock response, comprising an important component of the stress response which may therefore underscore sensitivity to stress. To this end we subjected the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana to a full-factorial design with three temperatures and three levels of inbreeding, and measured the expression of heat-shock protein (HSP) 70 via qPCR. HSP70 expression increased after exposure to heat as compared with cold or control conditions. Most strikingly, inbreeding strongly interfered with the heat-shock response, with inbred individuals showing a very weak upregulation of HSP70 only. Our results thus indicate that, in our study organism, interference with the heat-shock response may be one mechanism underlying reduced fitness of inbred individuals, especially when exposed to stressful conditions. However, these indications need to be corroborated using a broader range of different temperatures, genes and taxa.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.mh742/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.66172","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.66172","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25074571","doi:10.1038/hdy.2014.72"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.mh742"}}
