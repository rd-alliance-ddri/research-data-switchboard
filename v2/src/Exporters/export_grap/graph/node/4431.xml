We investigate the impact of these forces on SSD evolution in New World pitvipers (Crotalinae). We constructed a phylogeny from up to eight genes (seven mitochondrial, one nuclear) for 104 species of NW crotalines. We gathered morphological and ecological data for 82 species for comparative analyses. There is a strong signal of sexual selection on male size driving SSD, but less evidence for fecundity selection on female size across lineages. No support was found for allometric scaling of SSD (Rensch's rule), nor for directional selection for increasing male size (the Fairbairnâ€“Preziosi hypothesis) in NW crotalines. Interestingly, arboreal lineages experience higher rates of SSD evolution and a pronounced shift to female-biased dimorphism. This suggests that fecundity selection on arboreal females exaggerates ecologically mediated dimorphism, whereas sexual selection drives male size in terrestrial lineages. We find that increasing SSD in both directions (male- and female-biased) decreases speciation rates. In NW crotalines, it appears that increasing magnitudes of ecologically mediated SSD reduce rates of speciation, as divergence accumulates within species among sexes, reducing adaptive divergence between populations leading to speciation.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.rf18s/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.rf18s/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.59065","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.59065","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/jeb.12349","PMID:24597708"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rf18s"}}
