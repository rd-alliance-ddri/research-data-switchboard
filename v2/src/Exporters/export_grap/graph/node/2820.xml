Here, we report for the first time the presence of these signal transduction proteins in the caecum of a non-human primate, the common marmoset. Quantitative RT-PCR data on the gene expression of taste signal transduction molecules (gustducin and TRPM5) in common marmosets suggested high expression in the caecum, which was not observed in other non-human primates. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the specific presence of gustducin and taste receptors in marmoset caecal cells. These results may relate to the specific feeding behaviour of marmosets, which consume plant exudates, primarily gums.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.s3m5s/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.s3m5s/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.s3m5s/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.s3m5s/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.50866","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.50866","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0409","PMID:23843216"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s3m5s"}}
