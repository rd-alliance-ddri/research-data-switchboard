Biology Letters 9(3): 20130041.","keywords":["obligate mutualism","thermal tolerance","Ficus","climate warming","Fig wasps"],"description":"Figs (Ficus) have a reciprocally obligate mutualism with tiny, short-lived (1–2 days) fig wasps (Agaonidae). The small size and short life of these pollinators is expected to make them more vulnerable to climate change than their larger and longer-lived hosts. We experimentally tested the thermal tolerances of four species of adult female fig wasps from equatorial Singapore. The results suggest that an increase of ≥ 3oC above the current temperatures experienced across much of the equatorial tropics would markedly decrease the active adult lifespan of all four species. Fig plants are the center of an intricate web of specialist and generalist animals. Unless fig wasps can acclimate or adapt to warmer temperatures in time, these responses may disrupt the mutualism, potentially affecting multiple trophic levels.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.46988","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.46988","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0041","PMID:23515979"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hj7h2"}}
