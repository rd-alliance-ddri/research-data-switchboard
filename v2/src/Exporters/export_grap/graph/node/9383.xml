Long-term variability and dynamics of estuarine meiobenthic populations (1973-1992).","keywords":["South Carolina","Georgetown"],"description":"The original purpose of this research was to determine if natural\n     meiobenthic assemblages exhibited continuity over time and to monitor\n     several physical variables to determine if these influenced long-term\n     temporal patterns.  The most recent study focused on variation and the\n     relations of meiobenthos abundance with environmental factors over 11\n     years.  Typically marine benthic community studies are limited temporally\n     and the majority of previously published 'longterm' meiofauna results (all\n     taxa) were based on about a year's duration.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.33430","name":["RichardZingmark","WilliamConner","RichardDame","JamesMorris","DennisAllen","WilliamMichener","BruceCoull","JohnDean","ThomasWilliams","StephenStancyk","ElizabethBlood","F.Vernberg","BjornKjerfve","RobertFeller","LeonardGardner","HenryMcKeller","KeithBildstein","DonaldEdwards"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.33430","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-nin.12547.3/xml","knb-lter-nin.12547.3"]}}
