Theoretically, such constraints can maintain individual specialization by preventing adaptation to all niches available, but empirical evidence of them remains elusive for natural populations. This problem may be compounded by a tendency to seek constraints involving multiple traits, neglecting their added potential to manifest in trait expression across environments (i.e., within reaction norms). By replicating genotypes of a colonial marine invertebrate across successional stages in its local community, and taking a holistic approach to the analysis of ensuing reaction norms for fitness, we show the potential for individual specialization to be maintained by genetic constraints associated with these norms, which limit the potential for fitness at one successional stage to improve without loss of fitness at others. Our study provides new insight into the evolutionary maintenance of individual specialization in natural populations and reinforces the importance of reaction norms for studying this phenomenon.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q10d6/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52354","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52354","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24299414","doi:10.1111/evo.12220"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q10d6"}}
