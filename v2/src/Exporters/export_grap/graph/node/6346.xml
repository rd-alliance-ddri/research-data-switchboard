Various studies have shown that individual differences in social behaviour can be due to variation in exposure to developmental stress. However, whether these developmental differences translate to consistent differences in social network position is not known. We experimentally increased levels of the avian stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) in nestling zebra finches in a fully-balanced design. Upon reaching nutritional independence, we released chicks and their families into two free-flying rooms, where we measured daily social networks over five weeks using passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Developmental stress had a significant effect on social behaviour: despite having similar foraging patterns, CORT-chicks had weaker associations to their parents than control chicks. Instead, CORT-chicks foraged with a greater number of flock mates and were less choosy with whom they foraged, resulting in more central network positions. These findings highlight the importance of taking developmental history into account to understand the drivers of social organisation in gregarious species.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7qs06/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.72067","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.72067","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7qs06"}}
