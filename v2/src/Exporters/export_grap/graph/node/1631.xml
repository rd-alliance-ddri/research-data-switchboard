Analysis via x-ray microtomography reveals that the contact number Z grows with ϕ, but does depend on the preparation protocol. While there exist four different types of contacts in tetrahedra packings, our analysis shows that the edge-to-face contacts contribute about 50% of the total increase in Z. The number of constraints per particle C increases also with ϕ and even the loosest packings are strongly hyperstatic, i.e., mechanically overdetermined with C approximately twice the degrees of freedom each particle possesses.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qv331/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.50826","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.50826","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.028001","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qv331"}}
