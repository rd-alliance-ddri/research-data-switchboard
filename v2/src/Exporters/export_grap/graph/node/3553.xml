We eliminated intralocus conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by limiting transmission of all major chromosomes to males, thereby allowing them to win the intersexual tug-of-war. Here we show that this male-limited (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable, suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to development.  Sexual selection over size and shape of the imago may explain the persistence of substantial genetic variation in these characters and the ontogenetic processes underlying them.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1754","isReferencedBy":["PMID:20695965","doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02064.x"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1754"}}
