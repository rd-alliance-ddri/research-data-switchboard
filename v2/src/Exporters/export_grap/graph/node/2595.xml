Here we report 27 new whole genome sequences (2 complete and closed; 25 of draft quality) of cultured isolates, representing five major phylogenetic clades of Prochlorococcus. The sequenced strains were isolated from diverse regions of the oceans, facilitating studies of the drivers of microbial diversityâ€”both in the lab and in the field. To improve the utility of these genomes for comparative genomics, we also define pre-computed clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs), indicating how genes are distributed among these and other publicly available Prochlorococcus genomes. These data represent a significant expansion of Prochlorococcus reference genomes that are useful for numerous applications in microbial ecology, evolution and oceanography.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c/10","doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c/9","doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c/7"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.65565","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.65565","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1038/sdata.2014.34","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.k282c"}}
