While previous studies have shown that increased sex and recombination can evolve in the presence of host-parasite interactions (the “Red Queen hypothesis” for sex), many of these studies have assumed that multiple loci mediate infection versus resistance. Data suggest, however, that a major locus is typically involved in antigen presentation and recognition. Here, we explore a model where only one locus mediates host-parasite interactions, but a second locus is subject to directional selection. Even though the effects of these genes on fitness are independent, we show that increased rates of sex and recombination are favored at a modifier gene that alters the rate of genetic mixing. This result occurs because of selective interference that occurs in finite populations (the “Hill-Robertson effect”), which also favors sex. These results suggest that the Red Queen hypothesis may help to explain the evolution of sex by contributing a form of persistent selection, which interferes with directional selection at other loci and thereby favors sex and recombination.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pb5bh7hq/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.37617","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37617","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02468.x","PMID:22320180"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pb5bh7hq"}}
