Here, we show that what has been considered a single species in the eastern tropical Pacific, Porites lobata, includes a morphologically similar yet ecologically distinct species, Porites evermanni. While P. lobata reproduces mainly sexually, P. evermanni dominates in areas where triggerfish prey on bioeroding mussels living within the coral skeleton, thereby generating asexual coral fragments. These fragments proliferate in marginal habitat not colonized by P. lobata. The two Porites species also show a differential bleaching response despite hosting the same dominant symbiont subclade. Thus, hidden diversity within these reef-builders has until now obscured differences in trophic interactions, reproductive dynamics and bleaching susceptibility, indicative of differential responses when confronted with future climate change.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.d6108/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.d6108/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.55833","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.55833","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.1580","PMID:24335977"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d6108"}}
