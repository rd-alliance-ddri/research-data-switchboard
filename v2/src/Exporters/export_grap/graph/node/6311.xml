Natural populations have now spread the length of the western seaboard of Europe. To elucidate the demographic and selective processes at play during this rapid expansion, genome-scan analysis was performed on different populations. High diversities and low differentiation were observed overall, but significant genetic differentiation was found among newly-established populations and between the newly-established northern group and a nearly panmictic group composed of southern European populations and a population from Japan. Loss of genetic diversity was also seen in the north, likely caused by founder events during colonisation. The few strongly supported outlier loci revealed a genetic structure uncorrelated with the north/south differentiation, but grouping two samples from the Danish Fjords (northern group) and one from the Dutch Scheldt estuary (southern group) with the one from Japan. These findings might reflect: (i) parallel adaptation to similar environmental pressures (Fjord-like environment) within each of the two groups or (ii) a footprint of a secondary introduction of an alternative genomic background maintained by multifarious isolation factors. Our results call for a closer examination of adaptive genetic structure in the area of origin.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.13jc4/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.13jc4/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.13jc4/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.51096","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.51096","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24187588","doi:10.1111/eva.12086"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.13jc4"}}
