The record is the first of this genus from Taiwan and one of the southernmost occurrences of the Empria species in the Palaearctic. The new species appears to be close to E. wui Wei & Nie, 1998 and some other species from China and Japan with incomplete vein 2A+3A in forewing (unique among Empria). Remarkably, E. formosana shows considerable intraspecific variation for this character. The mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (ITS1 and ITS2) sequences of three undescribed species morphologically closest to E. formosana and E. wui indicate that most likely they all form a monophyletic group within Empria, defined here as E. wui species group.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.g6v8v5kq/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.37452","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37452","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1002/mmnd.201200021","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.g6v8v5kq"}}
