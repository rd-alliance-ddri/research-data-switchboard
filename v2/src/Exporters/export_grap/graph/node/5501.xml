This hypothesis is tested using published estimates of geographic range, individual size, and species richness of fungal-pathogens for 490 plant species occurring in the United States and controlling for sampling intensity and phylogenetic effects. The number of pathogens found on a plant species increases with the metrics of plant species' area and/or habitat diversity and their effects are similar between gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. The strength of this pattern across a diverse set of plant lineages suggests that accumulation and persistence of pathogen species on plant species are governed by the same processes among temperate plants.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.q1p71q5q/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.q1p71q5q/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35314","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35314","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22218316","doi:10.1086/663676"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q1p71q5q"}}
