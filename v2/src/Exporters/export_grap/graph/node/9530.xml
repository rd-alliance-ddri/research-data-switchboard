Measurements were collected using a StowAway Tidbit Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. TBIC32+4+27) beginning 2005-09-21.  The instrument depth was 000 meters, in an overall water depth of 21 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 4.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.30039","name":["PatrickDrake","MargaretMcManus","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.30039","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["SHB001_021MTBD000R00_20050921.50.6","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/SHB001_021MTBD000R00_20050921.50.6/xml"]}}
