Here, we investigated the effects of high levels of aliphatic- and indolic-glucosinolates on life history traits and detoxification gene expression in two sibling species, B and Q, of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. High levels of aliphatic-glucosinolates decreased the average oviposition rate of both species, and reduced the survival and developmental rate of Q nymphs. High levels of indolic-glucosinolates decreased the oviposition rate and survival of nymphal stages of the B species and the developmental rate of both species. Molecular analyses revealed two major asymmetries between the B and Q species. First, specific GST genes (BtGST1 and BtGST2) were significantly induced during exposure to indolic-glucosinolates only in Q. This may reflect the genes putative involvement in indolic-glucosinolates detoxification and explain the species' good performance on plants accumulating indolic-glucosinolates. Second, the constitutive expression of eight of the ten detoxification genes analyzed was higher in the Q species than in the B species. Interestingly, four of these genes were induced in B in response to high levels of glucosinolates. It seems, therefore, that the B and Q species differ in their \"optimal defense strategy\". B utilizes inducible defenses which are profitable if the probability of experiencing the stress is small and its severity is low, while Q invests significant resources in being always \"ready\" for a challenge.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.40423","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.40423","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22849567","doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05713.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.304pm"}}
