These ‘head direction’ cells are largely confined to a closely-connected network of sites.  We describe, for the first time, a population of head direction cells in nucleus reuniens of the thalamus in the freely-moving rat. This novel subcortical head direction signal potentially modulates the hippocampal CA fields directly and, thus, informs spatial processing and memory.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j68v0/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62954","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62954","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25024427","doi:10.7554/eLife.03075"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j68v0"}}
