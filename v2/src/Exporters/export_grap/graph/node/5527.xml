In C3 plants (e.g., rice, wheat), elevated concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO2) reduce protein and nitrogen concentrations, and can increase the total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC; mainly starch, sugars). However, contradictory findings have obscured the effect of eCO2 on the ionome - the mineral and trace-element composition - of plants. Consequently, CO2-induced shifts in plant quality have been ignored in the estimation of the impact of global change on humans. This study shows that eCO2 reduces the overall mineral concentrations (-8%, 95% confidence interval: -9.1 to -6.9, p carbon:minerals in C3 plants. The meta-analysis of 7,761 observations, including 2,264 observations at state of the art FACE centers, covers 130 species/cultivars. The attained statistical power reveals that the shift is systemic and global. Its potential to exacerbate the prevalence of 'hidden hunger' and obesity is discussed.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.6356f/11","doi:10.5061/dryad.6356f/12","doi:10.5061/dryad.6356f/16","doi:10.5061/dryad.6356f/17"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58407","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58407","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.7554/eLife.02245","PMID:24867639"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6356f"}}
