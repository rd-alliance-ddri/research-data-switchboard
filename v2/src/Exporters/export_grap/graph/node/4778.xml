In livestock, resolving the differences between the effects of initial domestication and of subsequent modern breeding is not straightforward without aDNA data. Here, we have obtained shotgun genome sequence data from a 16th century pig from Northeastern Spain (Montsoriu castle), the ancient pig was obtained from an extremely well-preserved and diverse assemblage. In addition we provide the sequence of three new modern genomes from an Iberian pig, Spanish wild boar and a Guatemalan Creole pig. Comparison with both mitochondrial and autosomal genome data shows that the ancient pig is closely related to extant Iberian pigs and to European wild boar. Although the ancient sample was clearly domestic, admixture with wild boar also occurred, according to the D-statistics. The close relationship between Iberian, European wild boar and the ancient pig confirms that Asian introgression in modern Iberian pigs has not existed or has been negligible. In contrast, the Guatemalan Creole pig clusters apart from the Iberian pig genome, likely due to introgression from international breeds.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sd784/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68953","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68953","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sd784"}}
