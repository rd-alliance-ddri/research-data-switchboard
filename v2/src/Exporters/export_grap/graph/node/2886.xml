Nineteen genera and 32 species were examined and (re-)illustrated with high-resolution scanning electron microscopy images. One new species Cytheropteron paramassoni n. sp. is described and one new name Eucytherura zehali is proposed for Eucytherura hazeli Yasuhara et al., 2009. This study provides updated taxonomic information for deep-sea ostracode genera and species from the eastern North Atlantic, which is an important baseline for application of deep-sea ostracodes to paleoceanographical reconstructions and paleoecological studies in this region.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.61791","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.61791","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1666/13-125","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.55d46"}}
