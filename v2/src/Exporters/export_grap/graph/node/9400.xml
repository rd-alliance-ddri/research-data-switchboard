These manuscripts were digitized into four non-overlapping coverages.  Each coverage was turned into a region and the UNION command was used to combine the data into a single coverage of salvage sale regions.  The road layer was buffered by 50 yards (45.72 meters)and these areas were added to the coverage.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.18518","name":["TheresaValentine","W.McKee"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.18518","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-and.3237.4/xml","knb-lter-and.3237.4"]}}
