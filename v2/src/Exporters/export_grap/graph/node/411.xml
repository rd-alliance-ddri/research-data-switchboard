Detecting such traits is especially difficult when they undergo frequent transitions between states. Self-incompatibility, the ability of hermaphrodites to enforce outcrossing, is frequently lost in flowering plants, enabling self-fertilization. We show, however, that in the nightshade plant family (Solanaceae), species with functional self-incompatibility diversify at a significantly higher rate than those without it. Apparent short-term advantages of potentially self-fertilizing individuals are therefore offset by strong species selection, which favors obligate outcrossing.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1888","isReferencedBy":["PMID:20966249","doi:10.1126/science.1194513"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1888"}}
