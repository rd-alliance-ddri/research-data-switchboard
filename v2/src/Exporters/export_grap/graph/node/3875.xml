Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are important in Drosophila mate choice, but relatively little is known about the underlying genetic architecture of CHC profiles in Drosophila simulans. Here we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate patterns of genetic variation in the CHC profiles of male and female D. simulans using iso-female lines. We found substantial genetic variation for CHC profiles and individual CHC components, and individual CHCs were frequently strongly genetically correlated, with a tendency for negative covariance between long and short chain CHCs in males. Intersexual genetic covariances were often weak and frequently differed in sign. These findings are novel and significant, highlighting the previously unexplored genetic architecture of CHCs in D. simulans and suggest that this architecture may facilitate sex-specific CHC evolution.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5s74n2j0/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35649","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35649","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1093/jhered/esr132","PMID:22268163"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5s74n2j0"}}
