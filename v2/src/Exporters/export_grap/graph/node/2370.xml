Three major mtDNA clades were identified for these species, but individuals were clustered by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) according to geography rather than morphology, suggesting that the colour morphs are interbreeding.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8982/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8982","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8982","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.03104.x","PMID:22026611"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8982"}}
