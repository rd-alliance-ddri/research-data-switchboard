The bags were then placed upon the soil surface along transects 1, 5, and 15 meters upslope from the stream (as described for microbial C and N).  Bags were placed in the field in December, 1993. Three replicate bags of each litter type were collected from both sites and all transects, every three months. Upon retrieval, leaves were dried and cleaned of any residual soil particles. Samples were then weighed to determine percent weight loss, over time. | In these data files, litter decomp studies are saved by species (Q. prinus or R. max) and then by distance from the stream (1, 5, or 15 meters). The # of days column is the amount of time the bags were in the field. % weight remaining is the proportion of weight upon collection to initial weight. This is followed by the average % weight remaining for each collection date and its standard deviation. The average C/N is the C/N ratio for the litterbags, by collection date. The total C and N for litter was determined using the Carlo Erba Total C and N analyzer.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.14272","name":["David C.
