However, empirical evidence for generalist fitness costs remains scarce. We used published data from a long-term field survey of aphid parasitoids to determine if relative specialists are more abundant than generalists on their shared hosts, a pattern that would be expected if generalists suffer a tradeoff between host-range breadth and host-use efficiency. Relative specialists were more abundant than generalists on their shared hosts, but only when we used a measure of specialization that accounts for the taxonomic differences among parasitoids' hosts. These results suggest that a generalist-specialist tradeoff exists within this group of parasitoids, and that the generalist fitness cost depends on the taxonomic breadth, rather than the number, of host species that are used.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7924/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.7924","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.7924","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21460548","doi:10.1086/658177"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7924"}}
