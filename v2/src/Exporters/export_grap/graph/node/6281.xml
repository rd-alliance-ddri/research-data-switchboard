Within this context, integrative approaches including molecular information are becoming more popular to solve the phylogenetic positioning of conflictive taxa. Here we present the description of a new lumbricid species from the region of Extremadura (Spain), Eiseniona gerardoi sp. n. The assignment to this genus is based on both a morphological and a phylogenetic study. The validity of the genus Eiseniona, one of the most controversial within Lumbricidae, is discussed. A synopsis of the differences between the type species and the west-European members of the genus is provided.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5k76c/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.61512","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.61512","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3897/zookeys.399.7273","PMID:24843253"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5k76c"}}
