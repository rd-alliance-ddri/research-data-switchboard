However, carrion crows Corvus corone corone can benefit from parasitism by the great spotted cuckoo Clamator glandarius. Parasitized nests have lower rates of predation-induced failure due to production of a repellent secretion by cuckoo chicks, but among nests that are successful, those with cuckoo chicks fledge fewer crows. The outcome of these counterbalancing effects fluctuates between parasitism and mutualism each season, depending on the intensity of predation pressure.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.j81r0/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.j81r0/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.j81r0/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.j81r0/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.j81r0/4"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.60059","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.60059","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24653032","doi:10.1126/science.1249008"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j81r0"}}
