Species of the Australian Gehyra gecko radiation have historically proven difficult to delimit due the groupâ€™s uniform, almost continent-wide geographic distribution and conservative morphology, contrasting high chromosomal and genetic diversity. Using an integrated approach to species delimitation taking advantage of morphological, geographic distributional and multi-locus genetic data, we investigate the diversity within three Gehyra species from the Australian arid zone. Our results show that these species represent eight distinct phylogenetic lineages, which display different patterns of morphological distinction and reproductive isolation. Using a recently developed Bayesian species delimitation method, we also find different levels of support for putative species dependent on priors for population size and timing of diversification assumed. Our results show that the current taxonomy does not adequately account for the diversity of the group. Discrepancies between lines of evidence indicate that diversification of the group is recent and ongoing, thus posing challenges for both species concepts and delimitation.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.2hv53/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.2hv53/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.2hv53/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.47980","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47980","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2013.03.007","PMID:23507430"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2hv53"}}
