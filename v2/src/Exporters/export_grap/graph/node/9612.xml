For each time slice, plot (1) shows δ18O against test size, plot (2) carbon δ13C against test size and plot (3) δ13C verses δ18O, (cross plots are a typical method for interpreting planktonic foraminifera depth habitats and are therefore useful for comparison of our results with the wider literature). Test size is represented as the mid point in the upper and lower sieve size range. Genera abbreviations as follows M = Morozovella, Pr = Praemurica, S = Subbotina, P = Parasubbotina, E = Eoglobigerina, C = Chiloguembelina, G = Guembelitria, Pa = Parvularugoglobigerina and W = Woodringina. Grey vertical dashed lines indicate approximate onset of adult ecology for planktonic foraminifera according to Brummer et al. (1987). Time Slice D, H, I, J, K, M, P and Q data, this study. A to C data from D’Hondt and Zachos (1993), DSDP Site 528 and 577 and E, G, L, N, O and R from Norris (1996), DSDP Site 384. ΔT = maximum interspecies δ18O offset equivalent to inferred maximum temperature offset; ΔM = inferred metabolic fractionation disequilibrium effects; ΔS = inferred photosymbiotic disequilibrium effects; ΔD = represents interspecies δ13C offsets. Ages are based on the ODP Leg 208 time scale of Westerhold et al (2008). Site 528, 577 and 384 ages were converted by linear interpolation from Cande and Kent (1995).","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.37964","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37964","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5p92t38g/1"}}
