Biology Letters 9(3): 20130140.","keywords":["Testosterone","Performance","Facial structure","Sports"],"description":"In our daily lives, we use faces as a major source of information about other people. Recent work has begun to highlight how one's facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) is linked to a number of behaviours (e.g. deception, aggression and financial performance in firms). fWHR has also been linked to several factors that may be beneficial for sport (e.g. achievement drive, winning mentality and aggression). Despite this, few studies have examined the relationship between fWHR and sports performance, and these have focused on Caucasian sportsmen. Here, we investigated the relationship between fWHR and baseball performance in professional Japanese baseball players. We show that fWHR is positively related with home run performance across two consecutive seasons. The findings provide the first evidence linking fWHR to baseball performance and linking fWHR to behavioural outcomes in Asian participants.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rv857/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.47526","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47526","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0140","PMID:23576779"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rv857"}}
