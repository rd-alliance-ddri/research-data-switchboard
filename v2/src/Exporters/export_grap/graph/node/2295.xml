Analyses were based on mitochondrial (~940 bp cyt b) and Y-chromosomal (~2020 bp from three introns) genetic variation. Our data provide conclusive evidence for a Caucasian and Middle Eastern origin for the three species and a subsequent westward expansion of C. nivalis. In addition, we discuss the taxonomic status of the genus Chionomys in relation to the genus Microtus.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/9","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4/7"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36006","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36006","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2011.12.004","PMID:22182990"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.n5k77dd4"}}
