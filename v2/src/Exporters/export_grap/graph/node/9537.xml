Vertical CTD profiles were collected at approximately 2km intervals from 0km to 36km during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure, optical back scatter, photosynthetically-available radiation, oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected during the upcast were deleted. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.28421","name":["KiRyongKang","DanielaDi Iorio","Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.28421","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-gce.73.25","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.73.25/xml"]}}
