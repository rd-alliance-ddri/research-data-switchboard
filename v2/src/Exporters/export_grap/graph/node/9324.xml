Measurements are for the ice free season (March â€“ December). No Discharge was determined because beaver activity prevented rating curve estimate. Several day gaps occur periodically due to removal for recalibration.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.15597","name":["WilfredWollheim","BrianPellerin","CharlesVorosmarty"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.15597","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-pie.115.4","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-pie.115.4/xml"]}}
