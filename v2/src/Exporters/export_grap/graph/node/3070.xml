I explore the possibility that foraging mode, the way individuals exploit resources, varies as a function of spatial position in the group, reflecting commonly occurring spatial differences in predation risk. I show that semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), a social foraging avian species, tended to adopt a riskier foraging mode in the central, more protected areas of their groups. Central birds effectively used the more peripheral group members as sentinels, allowing them to exploit a wider range of resources within the same group at the same time. This finding provides a novel benefit of living in groups, which may have a broad relevance given that social foraging species often exploit a large array of resources.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hm690/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53756","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53756","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24108674","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0528"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hm690"}}
