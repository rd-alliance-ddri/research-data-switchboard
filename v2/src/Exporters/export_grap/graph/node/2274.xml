Here, we show that the growth and reproductive effort of individuals of the dioecious herb Mercurialis annua depended on whether males or females had been growing in the soil previously. This suggests that males and females of M. annua differentially modify the soil in which they are growing. Our study indicates that sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants can give rise to increased environmental heterogeneity as a consequence of sex-specific niche modification.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1981/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.1981","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1981","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02089.x","PMID:20825527"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1981"}}
