Quantitative genetic studies, however, traditionally explore the outcome of an interaction between males and females based solely on the genotype of one sex, treating the other sex as a source of environmental variance. Here we use a half-sib breeding design in the field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, to estimate the additive genetic contribution of both partners to three steps of the mate choice process: the time taken to mate; the duration of spermatophore attachment; and, the intensity of mate guarding. Rather than each sex contributing equally to the interactions, we found that genetic variation for latency to mate and spermatophore attachment was sex-specific, and in the case of mate guarding intensity, largely absent. For a given interaction, genetic variation in one sex also appears to be largely independent of the other, and is also uncorrelated with the other traits. We discuss how pre- and post-copulatory interactions have the potential to evolve as an interacting phenotype, but that any co-evolution between these traits, due to sexual selection or sexual conflict, may be limited.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.172s5/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.172s5/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.172s5/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.45699","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.45699","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23730774","doi:10.1111/evo.12067"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.172s5"}}
