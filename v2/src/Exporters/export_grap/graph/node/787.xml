The identification of key processes responsive to grazing is crucial to optimize grassland management. In this comprehensive case study of a Chinese typical steppe, we present an in-depth analysis of grazing effects on N dynamics including the balance of N gains and losses, and N cycling. N pools and fluxes simultaneously quantified on three grassland sites of different long-term grazing intensities. Dust deposition, wind erosion, and wet deposition were predominant but most variable processes contributing to N losses and gains. Heavy grazing increased the risk of N losses by wind erosion. Haymaking and sheep excrements export to folds during night time keeping were important pathways of N losses from grassland sites. Compared to these fluxes, gaseous N losses (N2O, NO, N2 and NH3), and N losses via export of sheep live weight and wool were of minor relevance. Our N balance calculation indicated mean annual net N losses of 0.9 ({plus minus}0.8) g N m-2 at the heavily grazed site, whereas the long-term ungrazed site was an N sink receiving mean annual inputs of 1.8 ({plus minus}1.1) g N m-2, mainly due to dust deposition. Heavy grazing reduced pool sizes of both topsoil organic N, and above- and belowground biomass and N fluxes with regard to plant N uptake, decomposition, gross microbial N turnover, and immobilization. Most N-related processes were more intensive in seasons of higher water availability indicating complex interactions between land use intensity and climate variability. The projected increase of atmospheric N depositions and changes in rainfall pattern superimposed by land use change will likely affect N sink-source pathways and N flux dynamics, indicating high potential impact on grassland ecosystem functions. Land use practices will be increasingly important for the management of N dynamics in Chinese typical steppe and, therefore, must be considered as key component to maintain, restore or optimize ecosystem services.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/10","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/9","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.48711","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.48711","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1890/12-0114.1","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s903c"}}
