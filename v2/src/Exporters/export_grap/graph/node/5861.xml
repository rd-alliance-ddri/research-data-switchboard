This raises the question how they can detect the arrival of spring and respond in a sensible way to sensory information during hibernation. Using evoked potentials from cold or hypoxic turtles exposed to vibration and light we show that hibernating turtles maintain neural responsiveness to light stimuli during prolonged hypoxia. Furthermore, turtles held under hibernation conditions for 14 days increase their activity when exposed to light or elevated temperatures, but not when exposed to vibration or increased oxygen. It is concluded that hibernating turtles are not comatose, but remain vigilant during overwintering in cold hypoxia, allowing them to respond to the coming of spring and to adjust their behavior to specific sensory inputs.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.9mg16/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.9mg16/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.9mg16/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.9mg16/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.9mg16/5"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.54336","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.54336","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0602","PMID:24108677"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9mg16"}}
