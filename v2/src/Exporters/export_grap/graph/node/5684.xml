We evolved isogenic haploid \nand diploid populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 200 generations in seven different environments. We measured the competitive fitness of all ancestral and \nevolved lines against a common competitor and find that in all seven environments haploid lines adapted faster than diploids, significantly so in three environments. We \napply theory that relates the rates of adaptation and measured effective population sizes to the properties of beneficial mutations. We obtained rough estimates of the \naverage selection coefficients in haploids between 2-10% for these first selected mutations. Results were consistent with semi-dominant to dominant mutations in four \nenvironments and recessive to additive mutations in two other environments. These results are consistent with theory that predicts haploids should evolve faster than \ndiploids at large population sizes.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8048/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.8048/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.8048/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.8048/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.8048/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8048","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8048","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02188.x","PMID:21159002"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8048"}}
