Science 336(6079): 351-352.","description":"Growing evidence for declines in bee populations has caused great concern because of the valuable ecosystem services they provide. Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in these declines because they occur at trace levels in the nectar and pollen of crop plants. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris in the laboratory to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, then allowed them to develop naturally under field conditions. Treated colonies had a significantly reduced growth rate and suffered an 85% reduction in production of new queens compared with control colonies. Given the scale of use of neonicotinoids, we suggest that they may be having a considerable negative impact on wild bumble bee populations across the developed world.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1805c973/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.38734","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38734","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22461500","doi:10.1126/science.1215025"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1805c973"}}
