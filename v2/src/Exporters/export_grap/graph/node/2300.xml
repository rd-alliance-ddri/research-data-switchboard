We examined how the presence and sex of an audience influenced aggression and victory display behaviour in field-captured and lab-reared field crickets (Gryllus veletis). Audience type, rearing environment, and their interaction were important predictors in all model sets. Thus audience type may impose different costs and benefits for competing males depending on whether they are socially experienced or not. Our results suggest that field-captured winners, in particular, dynamically adjust their contest behaviour to potentially gain a reproductive benefit via female eavesdropping and may deter future aggression from rivals by advertising their aggressiveness and victories.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.38n1m/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.50802","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.50802","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0449","PMID:23843219"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.38n1m"}}
