A few genes are transcribed before this stage but how this differential activation is accomplished is still an open question. We have performed ChIP-seq experiments on tightly staged Drosophila embryos and show that \nmassive recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with widespread pausing occurs de novo during the midblastula transition. However, âˆ¼100 genes are strongly occupied by Pol II before this timepoint and most of them do not show Pol II pausing, consistent with a requirement for rapid transcription during the fast nuclear cycles. This global change in Pol II pausing correlates with distinct core promoter elements and associates a TATA-enriched promoter with the rapid early transcription. This suggests that promoters are differentially used during the zygotic genome activation, presumably because they have distinct dynamic properties.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rv624/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52324","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52324","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.7554/eLife.00861","PMID:23951546"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rv624"}}
