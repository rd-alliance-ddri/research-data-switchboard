These rock outcrops form natural islands that isolate populations from each other. We investigated gene flow by pollen through paternity analyses of a bromeliad population in an area of approximately 2 ha in Espírito Santo State, Brazil. To that end, seed-rosettes and seedlings were genotyped using nuclear microsatellite loci. A plot was also established from the same population and specimens were genotyped to evaluate their fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) through analyses of spatial autocorrelation and clonal growth. Paternity analysis indicated that 80% of the attributed progenitors of the genotyped seedlings were from inside the study area. The pollen dispersal distances within the area were restricted (mean distance of 45.5 m, varying from 3 to 156 m) and fine-scale spatial genetic structure was weak (Fij = 0.0122, p < 0.001; Sp = 0.009). Clonal growth was found to be a rare event, supporting the monocarpy of this species.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.fn675/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.fn675/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.71087","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.71087","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fn675"}}
