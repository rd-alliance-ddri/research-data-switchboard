We evaluated whether the intra-annual reproductive synchrony of individual white spruce trees (Picea glauca) increased seed escape from their primary predispersal seed predator, North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Trees with cones that matured synchronously relative to those of other trees within red squirrel territories were significantly more likely to escape squirrel predation in years with both low and superabundant levels of cone production, generating a significantly positive linear selection differential for increasing intra-annual reproductive synchrony. Thus, this masting plant escapes seed predation in numbers through interannual synchrony in seed production and in time through intra-annual synchrony of seed availability.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8b2q1v1d/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36836","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36836","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22437182","doi:10.1086/664623"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8b2q1v1d"}}
