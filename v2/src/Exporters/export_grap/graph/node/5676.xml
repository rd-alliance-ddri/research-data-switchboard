The prevalence of sex is difficult to explain, due to its costs when compared with asexual reproduction. Yet, as reviewed by Crespi and Schwander, sex can be favorable in the presence of proliferating transposons. Transposons are similar to mutations, in that their integration to non-neutral loci is likely to have deleterious effects, and sexual recombination provides a potential mechanism to confine their accumulation.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.848ks/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.848ks/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58182","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58182","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24400851","doi:10.1111/mec.12662"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.848ks"}}
