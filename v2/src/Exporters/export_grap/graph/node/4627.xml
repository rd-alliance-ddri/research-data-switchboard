Biology Letters 8(1): 123-126.","keywords":["Dinosaur","Fossil record","Diversity"],"description":"Modelling has been underdeveloped with respect to constructing palaeobiodiversity curves, but it offers an additional tool for removing sampling from their estimation.  Here an alternative to subsampling approaches, which often require large sample sizes, is explored by the extension and refinement of a pre-existing modelling technique that uses a geological proxy for sampling.  Application of the model to the three main clades of dinosaurs suggests that much of their diversity fluctuations cannot be explained by sampling alone.  Furthermore, there is new support for a long-term decline in their diversity leading up to the K/Pg extinction event.  At present use of this method with data that includes either lagerstätten or ‘Pull of the Recent’ biases is inappropriate, although partial solutions are offered.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8949/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8949","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8949","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2011.0210","PMID:21508029"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8949"}}
