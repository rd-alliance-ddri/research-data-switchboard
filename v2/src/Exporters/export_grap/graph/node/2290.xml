We use branching processes and diffusion equations to calculate the probability that a deleterious allele hitchhikes and ﬁxes alongside an advantageous mutant. As expected, the probability of ﬁxation of a deleterious hitchhiker rises with the selective advantage of the sweeping allele and declines with the selective disadvantage of the deleterious hitchhiker. We then use computer simulations of a genome with an inﬁnite number of loci to investigate the increase in load after an advantageous mutant is introduced. We show that the appearance of advantageous alleles on genetic backgrounds loaded with deleterious alleles has two potential effects: it can ﬁx deleterious alleles and also facilitate the persistence of recombinant lineages that happen to occur. The latter is expected to reduce the signals of selection in the surrounding region. We consider these results in light of human genetic data to infer how likely it is that such deleterious hitchhikers have occurred in our recent evolutionary past.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8875/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8875","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8875","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01311.x","PMID:21884046"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8875"}}
