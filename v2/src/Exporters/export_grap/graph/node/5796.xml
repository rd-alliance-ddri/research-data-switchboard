Evolution 68(8): 2412-2420.","keywords":["Evolutionary Genomics","Chromosomal Evolution"],"description":"Similar to how the model of centromere drive explains the size and complexity of centromeres in monocentrics (organisms with localized centromeres), our model of holokinetic drive is consistent with the divergent evolution of chromosomal size and number in holocentrics (organisms with non-localized centromeres) exhibiting holokinetic meiosis (holokinetics). Holokinetic drive is proposed to facilitate chromosomal fission and/or repetitive DNA removal (or any segmental deletion) when smaller homologous chromosomes are preferentially inherited or chromosomal fusion and/or repetitive DNA proliferation (or any segmental duplication) when larger homologs are preferred. The hypothesis of holokinetic drive is supported primarily by the negative correlation between chromosome number and genome size that is documented in holokinetic lineages. The supporting value of two older cross-experiments on holokinetic structural heterozygotes (the rush Luzula elegans and butterflies of the genus Antheraea) that indicate the presence of size-preferential homolog transmission via female meiosis for holokinetic drive is discussed, along with the potential negative consequences of holokinetic drive in comparison with centromere drive.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f68f0/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62822","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62822","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24758327","doi:10.1111/evo.12437"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.f68f0"}}
