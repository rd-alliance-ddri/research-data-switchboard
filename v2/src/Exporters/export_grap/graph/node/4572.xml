Observations in southwestern Yunnan Province, China, revealed pollination by resin-collecting, female Megachile (Callomegachile) nr. faceta Bingham (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). These bees, at 14 mm in length, were in the predicted size range, confirming the utility of syndromes and models developed in distant regions. Phenotypic-selection analyses and estimation of adaptive surfaces and adaptive accuracies together suggest that the blossoms of D. bidentata are well adapted to pollination by their most common floral visitors.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8753/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.8753/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.8753/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8753","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8753","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21670584","doi:10.1086/660279"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8753"}}
