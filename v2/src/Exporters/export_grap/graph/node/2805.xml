Both stressors independently can compromise immune function, disease resistance and fitness in fish. The impact of UVB can also be exacerbated by interactions with environmental temperatures. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that UVB and temperature act synergistically to influence patterns of energy consumption and susceptibility to disease. We exposed mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, to a factorial design of low and high UVB levels and low (18°C) and high (25°C) temperatures. The combination of high UVB and high temperature interacted synergistically to suppress metabolism and exacerbate infection intensity by the fish pathogen whitespot (Ichtyhophthirius multifiliis). Given the rapid changes in the thermal environment globally, the interaction between UVB and temperatures on energy use and disease resistance could pose significant problems for aquatic animal health in the context of both pre-existing and emerging diseases.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.74b31/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.70053","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.70053","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25252833","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2014.0449"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.74b31"}}
