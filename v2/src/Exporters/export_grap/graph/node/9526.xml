Measurements were collected using micro-T Temperature Logger (NexSens DS1921G) beginning 2004-07-20. Site temperature loggers are bolted down in a wire cage at various locations within each site. Mussel growth temperature loggers are bolted down in a wire cage at high, mid, or low positions within a mussel bed. Temperature is recorded at 60.0 minute intervals.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.23282","name":["PISCO OSU Lab Manager","BruceMenge","FrancisChan","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.23282","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["YBHX00_XXXIBTNXHSR01_20040720.50.2","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/YBHX00_XXXIBTNXHSR01_20040720.50.2/xml"]}}
