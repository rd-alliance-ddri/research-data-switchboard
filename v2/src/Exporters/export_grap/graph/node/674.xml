DESIGN: Questionnaires were used to assess students' perception of the teaching programme. SETTING: A Medical School in the South of England. PARTICIPANTS: There were 106 final year medical students in the cohort. RESULTS: The teaching scored well in all facets analysed and scored best on enthusiasm, interactivity and communication. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a framework for how foundation and core trainees could provide a very well received teaching programme benefiting medical students, the doctors and the Medical School.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9rf90/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.43998","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.43998","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23204137","doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001544"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9rf90"}}
