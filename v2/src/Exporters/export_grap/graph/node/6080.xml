Mimicry of flowers has until now only been demonstrated in angiosperms, yet it has been hypothesized that the Malaysian orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus mimics a flower to attract pollinators as prey. Despite the popularity of this charismatic insect, this long discussed hypothesis has never been experimentally investigated. We found that, as predicted for mimicry, the color of H. coronatus is indistinguishable from the color of sympatric flowers for hymenopteran pollinators. Field experiments show that isolated mantises attract wild pollinators at a rate even higher than flowers and capture these pollinators as prey items. After over a century of conjecture, we provide the first experimental evidence of pollinator deception in the orchid mantis and the first description of a unique predatory strategy that has not been documented in any other animal species.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.g665r/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.g665r/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52482","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52482","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24334741","doi:10.1086/673858"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.g665r"}}
