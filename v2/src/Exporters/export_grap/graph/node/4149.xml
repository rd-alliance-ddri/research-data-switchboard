Each of the three geographic groups recovered (North American, Middle American, and South American) was comprised of a pair of currently recognized species, and four, three, and three geographically and genetically distinct phylogeographic lineages respectively. Diversification within Pheucticus appears to have occurred at a relatively constant pace throughout the Pleistocene and evenly across a broad latitudinal distribution. The Isthmus of Panama completion and Pleistocene glacial cycles both appear to have played prominent roles in the diversification of this group.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.844k8/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.51687","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.51687","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23769955","doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2013.05.022"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.844k8"}}
