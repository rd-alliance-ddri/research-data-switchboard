Vertical CTD profiles were collected at 1-2km intervals from the line of demarcation (station +00) to 28km upriver along the transect during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure and optical backscatter were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected on the upcast were deleted, and the remaining data were averaged within 0.5m depth bins and interpolated to produce a smooth profile for contouring. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.28697","name":["KiRyongKang","DanielaDi Iorio","Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.28697","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.60.14/xml","knb-lter-gce.60.14"]}}
