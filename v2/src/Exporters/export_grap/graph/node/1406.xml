We found that in mice inactivation of the clock gene Period1 profoundly changes innate routine behaviour programmes like those necessary for courtship, nest building, exploration and learning. These results in wild-type and Period1 mutant mice, together with earlier findings on courtship behaviour in wild-type and period-mutant Drosophila melanogaster, suggest a conserved role of Period-genes on innate routine behaviour. Additionally, both per-mutant flies and Period1-mutant mice display spatial learning and memory deficits. The profound influence of Period1 on routine behaviour programmes in mice, including female partner choice, may be independent of its function as a circadian clock gene, since Period1-deficient mice display normal circadian behaviour.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.3n010/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.59040","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.59040","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24598427","doi:10.1098/rspb.2014.0034"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.3n010"}}
