Here we use body-mass data from 3473 of 4510 extant mammalian species and an almost complete species-level phylogeny to determine the best model of log(body-mass) evolution across all mammals, split taxonomically and spatially. An early-burst model fits better across all mammals than models based on either Brownian motion or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, suggesting that mammals experienced a burst of morphological evolution relatively early in their history followed by slower change subsequently. We also use spatial models to investigate rates of body-mass evolution within ecoregions. These models show that around 50% of the variation in rate can be explained by just a few predictors. High estimated rates are associated with cold, low lying, species-poor, high energy, mainland ecoregions. We conclude that the evolution of mammalian body size has been influenced by a complex interplay among geography, climate and history.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1222","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1086/652466","PMID:20394498"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1222"}}
