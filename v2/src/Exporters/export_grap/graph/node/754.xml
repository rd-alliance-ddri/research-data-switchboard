Amplification errors, such as allelic dropout and false allele, may arise during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using such samples. A mathematical model which treats homozygotes and heterozygotes discriminately has been developed to measure sample quality and compute the confidence level of using multiple-tube approaches. We use plucked hair samples collected from 26 individual Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) to test the model. In this case, a confidence level of 99% can be achieved by three positive PCRs. If the sample quality is very poor and requires many PCR replicates, an alternative multiple-step genotyping method is recommended. This model enables researchers to optimize experimental protocols through pilot studies and obtain reliable genetic information using noninvasive sampling method.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8164/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.8164/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.8164/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.8164/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.8164/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.8164/6"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8164","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8164","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1007/s11434-011-4634-5","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8164"}}
