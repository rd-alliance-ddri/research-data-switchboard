With finite population size, stochastic dynamics can greatly reduce the potential for the maintenance of polymorphism, but this has yet to be explored in detail. Here, classical two-patch models are extended to predict: i) the probability of a locally beneficial mutation rising in frequency in the patch where it is favored, and ii) the critical threshold migration rate above which the maintenance of polymorphism is much less likely. Individual-based simulations show that these approximations provide accurate predictions across a wide range of parameter space.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8651/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8651","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8651","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21729066","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01277.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8651"}}
