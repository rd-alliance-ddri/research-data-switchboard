Theory abounds on how sex-specific selection, mate choice, or other phenomena should favor different types of sex-linked inheritance, yet evidence in nature remains limited. Here we use hormone assays in Trinidadian guppies to explore the extent to which linkage of male coloration differs among populations adapted to varying predation regimes. Results show there is consistently higher degree of X- and autosomal linkage in body coloration among populations adapted to low-predation environments. More strikingly, analyses of an introduced population of guppies from a high to a low predation environment suggest that this difference can change in 50 years or less.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.m4576rg5/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35454","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35454","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22380450","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01495.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.m4576rg5"}}
