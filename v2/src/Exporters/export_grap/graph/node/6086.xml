Using a single-cell alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we investigated how sex and migration affected rates of evolutionary rescue in a sink environment, and subsequent changes in fitness following evolutionary rescue. We show that sex and migration affect both the rate of evolutionary rescue and subsequent adaptation. However, their combined effects change as the populations adapt to a sink habitat. Both sex and migration independently increased rates of evolutionary rescue, but the effect of sex on subsequent fitness improvements, following initial rescue, changed with migration, as sex was beneficial in the absence of migration but constraining adaptation when combined with migration. These results suggest that sex and migration are beneficial during the initial stages of adaptation, but can become detrimental as the population adapts to its environment.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s42n1/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62943","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62943","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/evo.12440","PMID:24766084"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s42n1"}}
