Here, we undertake a major population genetic study of black rhinoceros in the Zimbabwe Lowveld, an area inhabited by over half of that country’s original Zambezi descendants plus one large population sourced from the relict KwaZulu stock of South Africa. Using nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data, we found much higher levels of genetic diversity in the indigenous Zimbabwean populations, where observed multilocus heterozygosity was 0.54 vs 0.40 in KwaZulu, and maternal haplotype diversity was 0.77 vs 0.03. We show, for the first time, that both gene pools can be differentiated from each other on the basis of nuclear markers. This, along with the discovery of recent gene flow between all Lowveld populations, suggests that Zimbabwean and South African gene pools were prehistorically connected.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.0d3v5/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.67642","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.67642","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1007/s10592-014-0632-x","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.0d3v5"}}
