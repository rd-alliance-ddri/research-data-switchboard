However, dispersal strategies and responses to spatial habitat alteration may differ between sexes. Here we analyzed spatial and temporal variation in ten polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci of male and female Cabanisâ€™s greenbuls (Phyllastrephus cabanisi), a cooperative breeder of Afrotropical rainforest, to quantify rates of gene flow and fine-grained genetic structuring within and among fragmented populations. We found genetic evidence for female-biased dispersal at small spatial scales, but not at the landscape level. Local autocorrelation analysis provided evidence of positive genetic structure within 300 m distance ranges, which is consistent with behavioral observations of short-distance natal dispersal. At a landscape scale, individual-based autocorrelation values decreased over time while levels of admixture increased, possibly indicating increased gene flow over the past decade.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s5573/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52450","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52450","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071624","PMID:23951208"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.s5573"}}
