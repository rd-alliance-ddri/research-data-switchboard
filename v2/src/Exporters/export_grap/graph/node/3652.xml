Science 331(6015): 303.","keywords":["mitochondria","Canine transmissible cancer"],"description":"Canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is an infectious cell line circulating in many feral dog populations. It originated once, about 10,000 years ago. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences from dogs, wolves, and a geographically diverse collection of CTVT samples indicate that the cancer has periodically acquired mitochondria from its host. We suggest that this may be because the cancerâ€™s own mitochondria have a tendency to degenerate, due to high mutation rates and relaxed selection, resulting in host mitochondria being more fit.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8081/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8081","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8081","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1126/science.1197696","PMID:21252340"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8081"}}
