Measurements were collected using a StowAway Tidbit Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. TBIC32+4+27) beginning 2005-10-16.  The instrument depth was 040 meters, in an overall water depth of 60 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.16244","name":["PatrickDrake","MargaretMcManus","Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.16244","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/TPT007_060MTBD040R00_20051016.50.8/xml","TPT007_060MTBD040R00_20051016.50.8"]}}
