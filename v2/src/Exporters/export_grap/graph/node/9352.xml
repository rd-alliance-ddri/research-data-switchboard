Visual surveys were conducted along 10 2m by 10m transects randomly allocated within the mid-marsh zone at each site.  All grasshoppers observed within each transect were counted and identified to species, if possible.  This survey was conducted as part of the GCE invertebrate monitoring program, and will be performed annually to assess long-term changes in relative species abundances across the GCE study area.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.28462","name":["StevenPennings","Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.28462","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-gce.1.15","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-gce.1.15/xml"]}}
