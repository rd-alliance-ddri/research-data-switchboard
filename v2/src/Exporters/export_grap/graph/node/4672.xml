While mimetic radiations have occurred in a variety of taxa, their role in speciation remains poorly understood. We study the Peruvian poison frog Ranitomeya imitator, a species that has undergone a mimetic radiation into four distinct morphs. Using a combination of colour–pattern analysis, landscape genetics and mate-choice experiments, we show that a mimetic shift in R. imitator is associated with a narrow phenotypic transition zone, neutral genetic divergence and assortative mating, suggesting that divergent selection to resemble different model species has led to a breakdown in gene flow between these two populations. These results extend the effects of mimicry on speciation into a vertebrate system and characterize an early stage of speciation where reproductive isolation between mimetic morphs is incomplete but evident.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.rd586/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.rd586/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.rd586/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.rd586/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.67805","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.67805","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25158807","doi:10.1038/ncomms5749"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rd586"}}
