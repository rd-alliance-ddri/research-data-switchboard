Here we consider the possibility that symmetry, particularly symmetry of the legs, in Jamaican children is linked to high sprinting speed in adults. Our study population was a cohort of 288 rural children, mean age 8.2 (±1 SD = 1.7) years in 1996. Symmetry was measured in 1996 and 2006 from the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of three lower-body traits and we constructed a lower body composite FA trait (Comp lb-FA). In 2010 we measured sprinting speed (for 90 m and 180 m races) in participants recruited from our original cohort. There were 163 untrained adults in our sample. We found: (i) high Comp lb and knee symmetry in 1996 and 2006 were linked to fast sprinting times in our 2010 runners and (ii) our sample of sprinters appears to have self-selected for greater symmetry. We conclude that high knee symmetry in childhood is linked to an ability to sprint fast in adult Jamaicans as well as a readiness to sprint.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rh8gr/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.51839","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.51839","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23977263","doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0072244"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rh8gr"}}
