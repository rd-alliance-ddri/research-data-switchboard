PBMs allow to deal with the high level of interactions and feedbacks which are intrinsic to ecological processes, but their complexity comes at the cost of computation time and memory. Because of that, there is a trade-off between the resolution satisfactory to describe ecological processes (e.g. organism, population, species, vegetation type â€¦), and the computing constraints when applying PBMs at a large spatial extent and/or long time periods.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.4254b/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.4254b/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.4254b/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.4254b/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.4254b/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68808","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68808","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12250","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4254b"}}
