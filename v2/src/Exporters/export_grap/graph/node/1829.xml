This study reveals that up to 48% of nSNPs specific to a single genome are deleterious in nature, which underscores the abundance of deleterious polymorphisms in humans.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.br63t4d0/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36746","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36746","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1534/genetics.111.137893","PMID:22267501"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.br63t4d0"}}
