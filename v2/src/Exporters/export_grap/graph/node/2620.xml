We sampled Western toad, Anaxyrus boreas, breeding populations over two seasons near their northern range limit in southeast Alaska. We sampled 20 ponds each during the summers of 2008 and 2009, with 14 ponds sampled in both summers. We found considerable turnover in the population genetic relationships among ponds in those two seasons, as well as biologically meaningful genetic differentiation between years within some ponds. We found relatively consistent relationships between major population centers, while the relationships between the central ponds and smaller, outlying populations differed year to year. This finding indicates that multiple years of genetic sampling may be important for understanding the genetic landscape of some populations.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6ss2t/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.71096","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.71096","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6ss2t"}}
