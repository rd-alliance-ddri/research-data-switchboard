Journal of Heredity 103(5): 703-710.","description":"We investigated the pattern of spatial genetic structure and the extent of gene flow in the pitcher plant flesh fly Fletcherimyia fletcheri, the largest member of the inquiline community of the purple pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. Using microsatellite loci, we tested the theoretical predictions of different hypothesized population models (patchy population, metapopulation or isolated populations) among 11 bogs in Algonquin Provincial Park (Canada). Our results revealed that the pitcher plant flesh fly exhibits a mixture of patchy and metapopulation characteristics. There is significant differentiation among bogs and limited gene flow at larger spatial scales, but local populations do not experience frequent local extinctions/recolonizations. Our findings suggest a strong dispersal ability and stable population sizes in F. fletcheri, providing novel insights into the ecology of this member of a unique ecological microcosm.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.gt875/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.gt875/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.39842","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.39842","isReferencedBy":"PMID:22878050","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gt875"}}
