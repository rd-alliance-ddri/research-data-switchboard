However, not all deficiencies of inference models result in unreliable phylogenetic estimates. The field of phylogenetics lacks a direct method to identify cases where model specification adversely affects inferences. Posterior predictive simulation is a flexible and intuitive approach for assessing goodness-of-fit of the assumed model and priors in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Here, I propose new test statistics for use in posterior predictive assessment of model fit. These test statistics compare phylogenetic inferences from posterior predictive datasets to inferences from the original data. A simulation study demonstrates the utility of these new statistics. The new tests reject the plausibility of inferred tree lengths or topologies more often when data/model combinations produce biased inferences. I also apply this approach to exemplar empirical datasets, highlighting the value of the novel assessments.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nc866/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.55037","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.55037","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1093/sysbio/syu002","PMID:24415681"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.nc866"}}
