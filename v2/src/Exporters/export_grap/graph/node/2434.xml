Through an approach that utilizes both molecular and non-molecular data, the species is shown to represent a previously unknown lineage within the family Icmadophilaceae characterized by the production of sporodochia and a sterile dimorphic thallus that resembles the unrelated genus Leprocaulon.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.43160/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42513","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42513","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1080/0028825X.2012.732093","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.43160"}}
