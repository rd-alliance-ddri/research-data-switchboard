While the first two species of Madagascar Flatidae were described by Guérin-Méneville (1844), it was Signoret (1860) who made the first real attempt to enhance our knowledge of the Hemiptera fauna of Madagascar by describing several additional species. Over the following century and a half, several investigators have turned their attention to this group of insects, with the final number of species recorded for the island reaching 76. Despite this long history of research , it is evident that much still remains to be done. Detailed taxonomic research will allow the natural history of Madgascar and changes in the biological diversity of its endemic ecosystems to be better understood. This paper should be considered as an introduction to a complex study on the systematics and phylogeny of worldwide Flatidae planthoppers.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d43j8/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.46306","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.46306","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3897/zookeys.319.4148","PMID:24039526"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d43j8"}}
