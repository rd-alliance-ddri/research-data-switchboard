Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 57(1): 466â€“470.","description":"Classically, the mitochondrial genome is sequenced by a series of amplicons using conserved PCR primers. Here we show how shot-gun transcriptome sequencing can be used to obtain the complete set of protein-coding genes from the mtDNA of four passerine bird species. With these sequences, we address the still unresolved basal Passerida relationships (Aves: Passeriformes). Our analysis suggests a new hypothesis for the basal relationships of Passerida, namely a clade grouping Sylvioidea and Passeroidea, with Paridae and Muscicapidae as successive sister groups to this clade. This study demonstrates the usefulness of next-generation sequencing transcriptome sequencing for obtaining new mtDNA genomes.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j5c2j/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.46750","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.46750","isReferencedBy":["PMID:20601014","doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2010.06.009"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j5c2j"}}
