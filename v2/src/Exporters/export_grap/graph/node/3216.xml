In this test, the former is represented by a single phylogeny connecting all sequences, whereas the latter is depicted by several, independent phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1). Importantly, in the original UCA test, the same alignment was used to represent both hypotheses. When applied to a particular data set of 23 universally conserved proteins, the test strongly favored a UCA scenario.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.gn376/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.gn376/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.61443","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.61443","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24958930","doi:10.1093/sysbio/syu041"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gn376"}}
