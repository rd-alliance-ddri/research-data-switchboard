Here we use next-generation sequencing of reduced representation libraries to establish nuclear DNA markers. To the best of our knowledge this dataset represents the largest genomic resource for Megabunus harvestmen available to date.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2/6"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.57150","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.57150","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12255","PMID:24655359"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.55qb2"}}
