Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a critical role in adaptive immunity, and many studies have examined female mate choice in relation to MHC variation. In common yellowthroats, females prefer males that have larger facial masks, an ornament associated with MHC variation, immune function and condition.  Here we also tested whether mating patterns are directly correlated with MHC diversity or similarity. Using pyrosequencing, we found that the presence of extra-pair young in the brood was not related to male MHC diversity or similarity between the female and her within-pair mate.  Furthermore, extra-pair sires did not differ from males they cuckolded.  MHC diversity is extremely high in this species, and it may limit the ability of females to assess MHC variation in males. Thus, mating may be based on ornaments, such as mask size, which are better indicators of overall male health and genetic quality.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.09760/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.42396","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.42396","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23055067","doi:10.1098/rspb.2012.1885"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.09760"}}
