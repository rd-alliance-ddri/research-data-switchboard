Journal of North Carolina Academy of Science 129(3): 71-81.","keywords":"maritime forest","description":"Molecular phylogenetic analyses of mtSSU and nrITS sequence data show that two new crustose species belong to the genus Loxospora. Both species are sterile asexually reproducing crustose lichens from the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain of eastern North America, and are chemically similar to L. lecanoriformis in producing 2-0-methylperlatolic acid. Loxosopora assateaguensis is a sorediate species that is described from a single locality on Assateague Island in Maryland. Loxospora confusa is a granulose-isidiate species that is widespread in the Mid-Atlantic with a disjunct population in the Joccassee Gorges of the southern Appalachian Mountains.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.t00r3/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49802","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49802","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.7572/2167-5880-129.3.71","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.t00r3"}}
