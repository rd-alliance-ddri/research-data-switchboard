Here we describe a novel function of TAFs in directing genomic occupancy of a transcriptional activator. Using liver-specific inactivation in mice, we show that the TAF4 subunit of TFIID is required for post-natal hepatocyte maturation. TAF4 promotes pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at post-natal expressed liver function genes and down-regulates a subset of embryonic expressed genes by increased RNA polymerase II pausing. The TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer interacts directly with HNF4A and in vivo TAF4 is necessary to maintain HNF4A-directed embryonic gene expression at post-natal stages and promotes HNF4A occupancy of functional cis-regulatory elements adjacent to the transcription start sites of post-natal expressed genes. Stable HNF4A occupancy of these regulatory elements requires TAF4-dependent PIC formation highlighting that these are mutually dependent events. Local promoter-proximal HNF4A-TFIID interactions therefore act as instructive signals for post-natal hepatocyte differentiation.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.62gj0/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.70046","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.70046","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.7554/eLife.03613","PMID:25209997"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.62gj0"}}
