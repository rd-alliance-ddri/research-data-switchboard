An important question is how the genetic variation underlying such polymorphisms is maintained. Numerous mechanisms have been discussed, including kin competition or frequency-dependent selection. In the context of sympatric speciation events genetic and phenotypic variation is often assumed to be preserved by assortative mating. Thus, recently, this has been advocated as a possible mechanism leading to the evolution of dispersal polymorphisms. Here, we examine the role of assortative mating for the evolution of trade-off driven dispersal polymorphisms by modelling univoltine insect species in a metapopulation. We show that assortative mating does not favour the evolution of polymorphisms. On the contrary, assortative mating favours the evolution of an intermediate dispersal type and a uni-modal distribution of traits within populations. As an alternative mechanism dominance may explain the occurrence of two discrete morphs.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8905/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8905","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8905","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01312.x","PMID:21884049"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8905"}}
