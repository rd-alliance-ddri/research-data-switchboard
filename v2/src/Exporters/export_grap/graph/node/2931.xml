The data do not exclude the possibility, however, that a trade-off between virulence and infectious transmission to uninfected bacteria also played a minor role.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.293mk/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.34486","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.34486","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01428.x","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.293mk"}}
