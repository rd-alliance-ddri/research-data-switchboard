Recently, a unique chimeric virus (CHIV) genome, which has apparently emerged via recombination between ssRNA and ssDNA viruses, has been discovered. Here we report on the assembly of 13 new CHIV genomes recovered from various environments. Our results indicate a single event of capsid protein (CP) gene capture from an RNA virus in the history of this virus group. The domestication of the CP gene was followed by an unprecedented recurrent replacement of the Rep genes in CHIVs with distant counterparts from diverse ssDNA viruses. We suggest that parasitic and symbiotic interactions between unicellular eukaryotes were central for the emergence of CHIVs and that such turbulent evolution was primarily dictated by incongruence between the CP and Rep proteins.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.19m2k/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53871","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53871","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1038/ncomms3700","PMID:24193254"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.19m2k"}}
