Although similar to the primarily-Madagascan genus Hispo in having an elongate and flat body, sequences of 28s and 16sND1 genes indicate that Jerzego is most closely related to Massagris and Tomomingi, a result consistent with morphology. Females of Jerzego and other genera of Hisponinae were found to have an unusual double copulatory duct, which appears to be a synapomorphy of the subfamily. Two species are transferred from Hispo, Jerzego bipartitus (Simon) comb. nov. and Jerzego alboguttatus (Simon) comb. nov. Diagnostic illustrations and photographs of living spiders are provided.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.272c3/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.67366","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.67366","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.11646/zootaxa.3852.5.5","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.272c3"}}
