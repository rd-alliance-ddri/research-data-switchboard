The magnitude of inbreeding depression as expressed in the field can be estimated given t and F via the method of Ritland (1990). For a given total sample size, the optimal design for the joint estimation of t and F requires sampling large numbers of families (100-400) with fewer offspring (1-4) per family. Unfortunately, the standard inference procedure (MLTR) yields significantly biased estimates for t and F when family sizes are small and maternal genotypes are unknown (a common occurrence when sampling natural populations). Here, we present a Bayesian method implemented in the program BORICE that effectively estimates t and F when family sizes are small and maternal genotype information is lacking. BORICE should enable wider use of the Ritland approach for field-based estimates of inbreeding depression. As proof of concept, we estimate t and F in a natural population of Mimulus guttatus. In addition, we describe how individual maternal inbreeding histories inferred by BORICE may prove useful in studies of inbreeding and its consequences.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/10","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/9","doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b/8"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.41847","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.41847","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1038/hdy.2012.58","PMID:22990309"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7455b"}}
