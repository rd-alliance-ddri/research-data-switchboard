Participated on this study 54 athletes between adults and youths from both genders. As measure instruments were used: Sport Motivation Scale (1995), Multidimensional Sportspersonship Orientations Scale (1997) and Bredemeier’s Athletic Aggression Inventory (1985). The data collection was performed during training. For the data analysis the Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation and Cronbach’s Alpha were used. The data evidenced that overall selfdetermined motivation was found to be a favorable factor in relation to a positive attitude towards sport’s social conventions, rules and judges influencing on the worry and compromise with the opponent, being able to interfere over the tendency to behave aggressively.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37330","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.4025/reveducfis.v19i2.5524","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sh811k0h"}}
