However, most research considers detritus as an\ninvariable pool and predation as the only interaction\nbetween carnivores and prey. Carrion consumption,\nscavenging, is a type of detrital feeding that should have\nwidespread consequences for the structure and stability\nof food webs. Providing access to high-quality\nresources, facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and\nphylogenetically widespread strategy. In this review,\nwe argue that scavenging is underestimated by 16-fold\nin food-web research, producing inflated predation rates\nand underestimated indirect effects. Furthermore, more\nenergy is generally transferred per link via scavenging\nthan predation. Thus, future food-web research should\nconsider scavenging, especially in light of how major\nglobal changes can affect scavengers.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8612","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1016/j.tree.2010.12.011","PMID:21295371"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8612"}}
