It is shown that C-positive segments are weakly visible in all four species which indicates a small amount of constitutive heterochromatin (CH). There were no signals after DAPI staining and some positive signals were discovered using CMA3 staining demonstrating absence of AT-rich DNA and presence of GC-rich clusters of CH. Nucleolus organizing regions (NORs) were revealed using Ag-NOR technique; argentophilic material mostly coincides with positive signals obtained using CMA3 staining.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hc52qb12/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.39104","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.39104","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3897/CompCytogen.v6i2.2950","PMID:24260661"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hc52qb12"}}
