Impact assessments tend to focus on overt behavioural responses leading to displacement, but trade-offs may also impact individual energy budgets through reduced foraging performance. Previous studies found no evidence for broad-scale displacement of harbour porpoises exposed to impulse noise from a 10 day two-dimensional seismic survey. Here, we used an array of passive acoustic loggers coupled with calibrated noise measurements to test whether the seismic survey influenced the activity patterns of porpoises remaining in the area. We showed that the probability of recording a buzz declined by 15% in the ensonified area and was positively related to distance from the source vessel. We also estimated received levels at the hydrophones and characterized the noise response curve. Our results demonstrate how environmental impact assessments can be developed to assess more subtle effects of noise disturbance on activity patterns and foraging efficiency.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1847s/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.62229","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.62229","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.1090","PMID:24850891"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1847s"}}
