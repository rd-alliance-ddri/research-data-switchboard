Previous work has demonstrated that dispersal can be context-dependent. However, factors affecting dispersal are typically considered in isolation, despite the probability that individuals make dispersal decisions in response to multiple, possibly interacting factors. We examined whether two ecological factors, predation risk and intraspecific competition, have interactive effects on dispersal dynamics. We performed a factorial experiment in mesocosms using backswimmers (Notonecta undulata), flight-capable, semi-aquatic insects. Emigration rates increased with density, and increased with predation risk at intermediate densities; however, predation had minimal effects on emigration at high and low densities. Our results indicate that factorial experiments may be required to understand dispersal dynamics under realistic ecological conditions.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j8b02/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.64088","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.64088","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2014.0287","PMID:24919703"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j8b02"}}
