Primers were tested on 46 individuals from two Fennoscandian populations and yielded an average of six to nine alleles per locus (range = 1–30) depending on the population. Average observed heterozygosities in the two populations were 0.16 (range = 0–0.91) and 0.36 (range = 0–1).","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8109","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21564691","doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2008.02368.x"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8109"}}
