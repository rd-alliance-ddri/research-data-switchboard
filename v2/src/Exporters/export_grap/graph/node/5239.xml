But how common are such eco-evolutionary responses to environmental change likely to be? Are they inevitable, or do they require a specific type of change? Can we accurately predict eco-evolutionary responses? We address these questions using theory and data from the study of Yellowstone wolves. We show that environmental change is expected to generate eco-evolutionary change, that changes in the average environment will affect wolves to a greater extent than changes in how variable it is, and that accurate prediction of the consequences of environmental change will probably prove elusive.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.bp23483h/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.bp23483h/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35448","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35448","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1126/science.1209441","PMID:22144626"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.bp23483h"}}
