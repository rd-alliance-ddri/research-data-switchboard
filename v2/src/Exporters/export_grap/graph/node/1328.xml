Native herbivores that colonize novel plants may contribute to diversityâ€“invasibility relationships by limiting the relative success of non-native plants. Here, we show that, in large collections of non-native oak trees at sites across the USA, non-native oaks introduced to regions with greater oak species richness accumulated greater leaf damage than in regions with low oak richness. Underlying this trend was the ability of herbivores to exploit non-native plants that were close relatives to their native host. In diverse oak communities, non-native trees were on average more closely related to native trees and received greater leaf damage than those in depauperate oak communities. Because insect herbivores colonize non-native plants that are similar to their native hosts, in communities with greater native plant diversity, non-natives experience greater herbivory.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.5b6t7/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.5b6t7/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.5b6t7/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.5b6t7/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.5b6t7/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.69329","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.69329","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25232143","doi:10.1098/rspb.2014.1841"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5b6t7"}}
