We analysed cranial shape variation using geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. Most variation involved the shape of the rostrum, basicranium, and cranial vault, and clearly matched the phylogenetic structure. At the same time, a strong allometric pattern was associated with the length of the rostrum and cranial vault, size of the auditory bulla, and depth of the zygomatic arch. After accounting for size influence, and taking phylogenetic structure into account, shape variation was significantly associated with habitat. Our results highlight the presence of complex relationships between morphological, phylogenetic, and ecological dimensions in the diversification of the caviomorph cranium.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c/5"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52061","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52061","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/bij.12164","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.qg67c"}}
