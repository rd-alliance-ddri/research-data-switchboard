Prevailing hypotheses predict that higher-ranking males experience higher testosterone and glucocorticoid (stress hormone) levels than lower-ranking males when hierarchies are unstable but not otherwise. In this long-term study of rank-related stress in a natural population of savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus), high-ranking males had higher testosterone and lower glucocorticoid levels than other males, regardless of hierarchy stability. The singular exception was the highest-ranking (alpha) males, who exhibited both high testosterone and high glucocorticoid levels. In particular, alpha males exhibited much higher stress hormone levels than second-ranking (beta) males, suggesting that being at the very top may be more costly than previously thought.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.j850j/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.j850j/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.j850j/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.j850j/4"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.33984","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.33984","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1126/science.1207120","PMID:21764751"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.j850j"}}
