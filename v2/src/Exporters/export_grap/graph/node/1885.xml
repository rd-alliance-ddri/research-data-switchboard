We found little geographic or temporal stratification of the genetic diversity among the sampled parasites. Through application of the iHS and REHH haplotype-based tests for positive selection, we found evidence of recent selective sweeps at a known drug resistance locus, at several known antigenic loci, and at several genomic regions not previously identified as sites of recent selection. We discuss the value of deep population-specific genomic analyses for identifying selection signals within sampled endemic populations of parasites, which may correspond to local selection pressures such as distinctive therapeutic regimes or mosquito vectors.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.731f5/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.40269","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.40269","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22688945","doi:10.1093/molbev/mss151"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.731f5"}}
