The latter was found on a single branch in a strongly supported clade with Muscicapoidea, Certhioidea and Bombycilloidea, although the relationships among these were unresolved. We conclude that the spotted wren-babbler represents a relict basal lineage within Passerida with no close extant relatives, and we support the already used name Elachura formosa and propose the new family name Elachuridae for this single species.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.hd765/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.hd765/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.hd765/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.hd765/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.hd765/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.59362","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.59362","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24598108","doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.1067"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hd765"}}
