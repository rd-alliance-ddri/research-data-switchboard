High-throughput amplicon sequencing is used to enumerate microbial and invertebrate communities at a high level of taxonomic resolution, but the method requires validation against traditional specimen-based morphological identifications. To investigate the consistency between these approaches, we enumerated nematodes from a 25-year field experiment using both morphological and molecular identification techniques in order to determine the long-term effects of annual burning and nitrogen enrichment on soil nematode communities. Family-level frequencies based on amplicon sequencing were not initially consistent with specimen-based counts, but correction for differences in rRNA gene copy number using a genetic algorithm improved quantitative accuracy. Multivariate analysis of corrected sequence-based abundances of nematode families was consistent with, but not identical to, analysis of specimen-based counts. In both cases, herbivores, fungivores and predator/omnivores generally were more abundant in burned than nonburned plots, while bacterivores generally were more abundant in nonburned or nitrogen-enriched plots. Discriminate analysis of sequence-based abundances identified putative indicator species representing each trophic group. We conclude that high-throughput amplicon sequencing can be a valuable method for characterizing nematode communities at high taxonomic resolution as long as rRNA gene copy number variation is accounted for and accurate sequence databases are available.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/8","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.47267","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47267","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24103081","doi:10.1111/mec.12480"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.t8g16"}}
