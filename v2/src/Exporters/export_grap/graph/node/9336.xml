We noted the number of visits to each subspecies. We also noted the different numbers of each transition type. Transition categories are detoed \"from_to\" (i.e. \"x_p\" transition was from a xantiana to a parviflora). We also noted that parviflora may have different colors (pp = pink; wp = white; up = unknown) and the should sum to the category with only a \"p\". We also have separate entries using all flowers or plants only (no geitnogamy). The entries with all flowers used end in \"_f\".","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.66768","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.66768","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.n4mm0/8"}}
