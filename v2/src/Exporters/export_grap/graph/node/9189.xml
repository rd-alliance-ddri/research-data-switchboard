Observed SuSt were obtained from the sequence data of four loci for the L. darwinii complex. Mean and standard deviation (StDv) of SuSt were calculated across simulated or observed loci. Abbreviations: Ï€ = mean of pairwise differences, S = number of segregating sites, MFS = mutation frequency spectrum. Details about the computation of these SuSt are given in user guide of the program popABC.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.38357","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38357","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4409k652/9"}}
