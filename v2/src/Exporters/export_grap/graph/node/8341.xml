However we show in our study that it should not be considered a Persicaria.\n- Eskemurkejea megacarpum has been treated as a Fagopyrum. Again, we choose the circumscription by Malick & Sengupta since the taxon is not placed with other Fagopyrum.\n- Muehlenbeckia platyclados was named Homalocladium, but as shown in previous studies it is nested within Muehlenbeckia. \n- Reynoutria sachalinensis ha been considered as Fallopia, but again our analyses support the naming Reynoutria.\n- Leptogonum domingense, Podopterus mexicanus, Coccoloba pallida are all valid names (see tropicos.or, ipni.org)","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8235","name":["Sanchez, Adriana","Kron, Kathleen","Schuster, Tanja","Burke, Janelle"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8235","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":"purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11026"}}
