We used multiple tests to identify several candidate genes that may be involved in local adaptation from 1026 loci in 14 natural populations of Cryptomeria japonica, the most economically important forestry tree in Japan. We also studied the relationships between genotypes and environmental variables to obtain information on the selective pressures acting on individual populations. Outlier loci were mapped onto a linkage map, and the positions of loci associated with specific environmental variables are considered. The outlier loci were not randomly distributed on the linkage map; linkage group 11 was identified as a genomic island of divergence. Three loci in this region were also associated with environmental variables such as mean annual temperature, daily maximum temperature, maximum snow depth, and so on. Outlier loci identified with high significance levels will be essential for conservation purposes and for future work on molecular breeding.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gt178/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.41162","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.41162","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22929151","doi:10.1038/hdy.2012.50"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gt178"}}
