In Africa, crocodilian systematics has been hampered by complex regional biogeography and confounded taxonomic history. We used rigorous molecular and morphological species delimitation methods to test the hypothesis that the slender-snouted croco- dile (Mecistops cataphractus) is composed of multiple species corresponding to the Congolian and Guinean biogeographic zones. Speciation probability was assessed by using 11 mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and cranial mor- phology for over 100 specimens, representing the full geographical extent of the species distribution. Molecular Bayesian and phylogenetic species deli- mitation showed unanimous support for two Mecistops species isolated to the Upper Guinean and Congo (including Lower Guinean) biomes that were supported by 13 cranial characters capable of unambiguously diagnos- ing each species. Fossil-calibrated phylogenetic reconstruction estimated that the species split + 6.5 â€“ 7.5 Ma, which is congruent with intraspecies diver- gence within the sympatric crocodile genus Osteolaemus and the formation of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. Our results underscore the necessity of com- prehensive phylogeographic analyses within currently recognized taxa to detect cryptic species within the Crocodylia. We recommend that the com- munity of crocodilian researchers reconsider the conceptualization of crocodilian species especially in the light of the conservation ramifications for this economically and ecologically important group.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47203","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.2483","PMID:24335982"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sh3m0"}}
