In the present study, the development, nymphal and adult feeding, adult behavior and communication by drumming of this species are investigated. This species inhabits a stream flowing through a cave, in darkness and with a constant temperature. Nymphs of different sizes cohabit throughout the whole year, showing a non-seasonal life cycle. Nymphs at the entrance of the cave feed mainly on coarse particulate organic matter and hyphae, and nymphs at the end of the cave feed principally on detritus and, occasionally, on animal matter. Adults were present year around and aggregated on emergent stones at the end of the cave. No drumming signals were recorded; therefore, this species seems to rely mainly on aggregation to maximize pair encounters. As shown in this study, P. gevi have adaptations suited to life in the dark and the completion of its entire life cycle inside of a cave.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8m8r1/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.8m8r1/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.8m8r1/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.40577","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.40577","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23070327","doi:10.1086/667888"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8m8r1"}}
