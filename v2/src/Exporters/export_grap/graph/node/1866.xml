This provides an interesting context to evaluate ecological and evolutionary theories relating to nutrient availability and leads us to: the assessment of theories about limitation of productivity and the integration of CO2 into the co-limitation paradigm; the prediction of community composition and of change in communities from known changes in the environment; and evaluation of the potential for evolutionary adaptation in conditions that increase growth.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1q77m/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.60481","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.60481","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24631287","doi:10.1016/j.tree.2014.02.006"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1q77m"}}
