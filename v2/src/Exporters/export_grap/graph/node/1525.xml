We surveyed Wolbachia infections in 187 specimens of the fig wasp species, Ceratosolen solmsi, and found an infection prevalence of 89.3%. DNA Sequencing of 20 individuals each from Wolbachia-infected and uninfected sub-populations revealed extreme mtDNA divergence (up to 9.2% and 15.3% in CO1 and cytochrome b, respectively) between infected and uninfected wasps. Further, mtDNA diversity was significantly reduced within the infected group. Our sequencing of a large part of the mitochondrial genome from both Wolbachia-infected and uninfected individuals revealed that high sequence divergence is common throughout the mitochondrial genome. These patterns suggest a partial selective sweep of mitochondria subsequent to the introduction of Wolbachia into C. solsmi, by hybrid introgression from a related species.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.475j7p93/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.475j7p93/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.475j7p93/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36527","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36527","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01561.x","PMID:22671555"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.475j7p93"}}
