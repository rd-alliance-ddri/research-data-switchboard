How animals integrate signal components across sensory modalities can influence signal evolution. Here we show that two relatively unattractive signals that are perceived acoustically and visually can be combined in a pattern to form a signal that is attractive to female túngara frogs. Such unanticipated perceptual effects suggest that the evolution of complex signals can occur by alteration of the relationships among already-existing traits.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pk85d/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.49587","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.49587","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23744778","doi:10.1126/science.1237113"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pk85d"}}
