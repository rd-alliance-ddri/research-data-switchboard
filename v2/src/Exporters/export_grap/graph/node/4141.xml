However, environmental variation and genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions have the potential to compromise the reliability of sexual signals. Here we test the reliability of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as signals of heritable aspects of male attractiveness in Drosophila simulans. We examined the heritability of male attractiveness and a measure of the difference between fathers and sonsâ€™ CHC profiles across dietary and temperature environments. Our results show that environmental heterogeneity disrupts the similarity of some components of father and son CHC profile. However, overall male attractiveness is heritable within and across environments, so that sire attractiveness is a good predictor of son attractiveness even with environmental heterogeneity. This suggests that although some male CHC signals are unreliable, attractive genotypes retain their attractiveness across environments on average.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.18h00/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.43146","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.43146","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/jeb.12045","PMID:23206188"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.18h00"}}
