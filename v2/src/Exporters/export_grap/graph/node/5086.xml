In contrast, a recent analysis for primates suggests that monogamy evolved as a form of paternal care that reduces the risk of male infanticide. Here we re-examine the distribution of monogamy in primates and attempt to explain the contrasting results of the two analyses.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.hc967/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.hc967/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.60964","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.60964","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1073/pnas.1401012111","PMID:24706849"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.hc967"}}
