Using Principal Coordinate Analysis and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling, it is demonstrated that distinct, contemporaneous, and geographically adjacent autochthonous facies in south-central Kentucky supported distinct crinoid assemblages. The two carbonate buildup facies had different assemblages dominated by camerate crinoids, carbonate channel-fill deposits were dominated by advanced cladid crinoids and the camerate Elegantocrinus hemisphaericus, and green shale facies supported a fauna dominated by disparids and primitive cladid crinoids. Allochthonous facies contain neither distinctive nor exotic taxa. Thus, these transported assemblage are considered a mixture of elements from the recognized, autochthonous facies. Faunal assemblages from Dale Hollow Reservoir are allochthonous; and faunas in north- central Alabama and south-central Tennessee are different from others, which may reflect slight biogeographic distinctions.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.bv432/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68193","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68193","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.bv432"}}
