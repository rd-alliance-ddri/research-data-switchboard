Data is divided into Own-or-Not where 1 reflects that the lizards and the habitat are the same, whereas 0 reflects that lizards come from a different location than the habitat squares. Habitat category reflects if the pair are both from an islet population (I), both from a mainland population (M) or from one islet- and one mainland population (IM).","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.63791","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.63791","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.h61v0/8"}}
