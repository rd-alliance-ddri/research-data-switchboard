Of interest were how roads influenced erosional processes and how flood-induced erosion affected the transportation network.  By employing concepts of sediment budgeting and disturbance cascades, this study aims to create a landscape context for understanding the impact of an extensive road network on the geomorphic imprint left by this flood of record in February 1996.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.20144","name":["FrederickSwanson","JuliaJones","BeverleyWemple"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.20144","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-and.4029.3/xml","knb-lter-and.4029.3"]}}
