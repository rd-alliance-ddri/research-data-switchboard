Measurements were collected using StowAway XTI Temperature Loggers (Onset Computer Corp. XTI32-05+37) beginning 2004-11-22.  The instrument depth was 004 meters, in an overall water depth of 020 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was -15.1 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.11280","name":["PatrickDrake","MargaretMcManus","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.11280","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["HMS001_020MXTI004R00_20041122.50.5","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/HMS001_020MXTI004R00_20041122.50.5/xml"]}}
