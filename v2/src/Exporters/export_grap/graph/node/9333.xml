Measurements were collected using a StowAway XTI Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. XTI32-05+37) beginning 2002-05-17.  The instrument depth was 005 meters, in an overall water depth of 19 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.30929","name":["PatrickDrake","MargaretMcManus","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.30929","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/HMS003_019MXTI005R00_20020517.50.5/xml","HMS003_019MXTI005R00_20020517.50.5"]}}
