We hypothesise that coastal species associated with buoyant seaweeds should experience enhanced population connectivity due to rafting. In particular, invertebrates strongly associated with the buoyant bull-kelp Durvillaea antarctica might be expected to have lower levels of population genetic differentiation than taxa mainly exploiting non-buoyant substrates. We undertook a comparative genetic study of two co-distributed, congeneric chiton species, assessing population connectivity at scales of 61-516 km, using â‰¥186 polymorphic AFLP loci per species. Consistent with predictions, population genetic differentiation was weaker in the kelp-associated Sypharochiton sinclairi than in the rock-associated S. pelliserpentis. Additionally, while we found a significant positive correlation between genetic and oceanographic distances in both chiton species, the correlation was stronger in S. pelliserpentis (R2 = 0.28) than in S. sinclairi (R2 = 0.18). These data support the hypothesis that epifaunal taxa can experience enhanced population-genetic connectivity as a result of their rafting-ability.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8m10n2mq/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.8m10n2mq/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.8m10n2mq/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35029","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35029","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22026515","doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05332.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8m10n2mq"}}
