Bacteria use two surface organelles to facilitate motility: a single polar flagellum, and type IV pili, enabling swimming in aqueous habitats and twitching along hard surfaces, respectively. Here, we address whether there are trade-offs between these motility mechanisms, and hence whether different environments could select for altered motility. We experimentally evolved initially isogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa under conditions which favoured the different types of motility, and found evidence for a trade-off mediated by antagonistic pleiotropy between swimming and twitching. Moreover, changes in motility resulted in correlated changes in other behaviours, including biofilm formation and growth within an insect host. This suggests environmental origins of a particular motile opportunistic pathogen could predictably influence motility and virulence.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.230t0/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.230t0/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.230t0/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.230t0/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.33916","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.33916","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22023574","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01376.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.230t0"}}
