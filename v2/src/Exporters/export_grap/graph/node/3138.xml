Any genetic framework for this genus is completely lacking at onset of this project. Work here is focused on species delimitation within the genus Dactylopius. In the first chapter I present a morphological description of a new species of Dactylopius from the Chihuahuan Desert. In the second chapter I delimit the cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus) using mtDNA data using a variety of population genetic and phylogenetic approaches. Third chapter I use mtDNA and nuclear coding and non-coding DNA to delimit the other species found within the genus sampled from across their recorded geographic and host-plant range.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.d772v/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.d772v/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.66424","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.66424","isReferencedBy":"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869933978","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.d772v"}}
