We screened microsatellite markers, mitochondrial DNA, and endosymbiont genes in 504 RWA clones from nineteen populations worldwide. Following pathway analyses of microsatellite and endosymbiont data, we postulate that Turkey and Syria were the most likely sources of invasion to Kenya and South Africa, respectively. Furthermore, we found that one clone transferred between South Africa and the Americas was most likely responsible for the New World invasion. Finally, endosymbiont DNA was found to be a high resolution population genetic marker, extremely useful for studies of invasion over a relatively short evolutionary history timeframe. This study has provided valuable insights into the factors that may have facilitated the recent global invasion by this damaging pest.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.fk0b9/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.fk0b9/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.60455","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.60455","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24617944","doi:10.1111/mec.12714"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fk0b9"}}
