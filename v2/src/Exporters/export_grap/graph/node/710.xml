Our approach can be used to generate templates from any DNA source for NGS. Here we test our approach by amplifying complete chloroplast genomes and we present a set of 58 potentially universal primers for angiosperms to do so. Additionally, this approach is likely to be particularly useful for nuclear regions. Methods and Results: Chloroplast genomes of 30 species across angiosperms were amplified to test our approach. Amplification success varied depending on whether PCR conditions were optimized for a given taxon. To further test our approach, some amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Conclusions: Although here we tested this approach by sequencing plastomes, long PCR amplicons could be generated using DNA from any genome, expanding the possibilities of this approach for molecular systematic studies.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.kc75n/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.56106","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.56106","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3732/apps.1300063","PMID:25202592"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.kc75n"}}
