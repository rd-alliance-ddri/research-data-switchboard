The new species is distinguished from both geographically proximate and closely related Phrynobatrachus species by the combination of its body size (larger than the closely related P. chukuchuku, P. manengoubensis, and P. werneri), degree of development of male traits, and a unique ventral colour pattern in males. Molecular phylogenetic analysis reveals that this new species is closely related to P. werneri and P. manengoubensis, which together with several other species form a clade restricted to the mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. This new Phrynobatrachus is the first known amphibian species hypothesized as endemic to the Mambilla Plateau of eastern Nigeria.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.1321","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1080/04416651003742160","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1321"}}
