The daytime resting behavior and lenght of activity period were also studied. Radio, tracking, oberservations and live trapping were the methods used to collect the data. Notes on colony composition, area and a comparison of movement and activity patterns between adults and juveniles within a colony were recorded. The two colonies were compared as to area, composition and general activity patterns. The mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles associated with each colony were also noted. An assessment of the use of radio-tracking as a method in the study of beaver ecology was also considered.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.24162","name":["EdwardBusher","James R.Sweeney","James P.Mackey","University of California Natural Reserve System","Sagehen Creek Field Station","Joseph G.Hall"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.24162","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/nrs.666.1/xml","nrs.666.1"]}}
