We use a tracking system to continuously monitor individually-tagged workers in six colonies of the ant Camponotus fellah over 41 days. Network analyses of over 9 million interactions revealed three distinct groups that differ in behavioral repertoires. Each group represents a functional behavioral unit with workers moving from one group to the next as they age. The rate of interactions was much higher within- than between groups. The precise information on spatial and temporal distribution of all individuals permitted calculation of the expected rates of within- and between-group interactions. These values suggest that the network of interaction within colonies is primarily mediated by age-induced changes in the spatial location of workers.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8d8h7/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.47970","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47970","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1126/science.1234316","PMID:23599264"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8d8h7"}}
