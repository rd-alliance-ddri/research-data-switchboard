This species is the second member of A. sect. Spathulata F.O.Khass. & R.M.Fritsch, being different from A. spathulatum F.O.Khass. & R.M.Fritsch in larger, broader, obtuse and more intensely purple-coloured tepals, and in a more robust habit. It is a local endemic of Babash-Ata Mt. Range situated east of Fergana Valley in Kyrgyzstan, recommended for legal protection as Endangered because of the very small population size in its only locality.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pq87t/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.47425","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.47425","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23794934","doi:10.3897/phytokeys.21.4130"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pq87t"}}
