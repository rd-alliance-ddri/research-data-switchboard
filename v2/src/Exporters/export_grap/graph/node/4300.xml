The traditional identification is mainly based on external morphological diagnostic characters, leading to inconsistent results in many cases. Here, we provide a sequence reference library based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) for a valid identification of 93 North Atlantic fish species originating from the North Sea and adjacent waters, including many commercially exploited species. Neighbour-joining analysis based on K2P genetic distances formed nonoverlapping clusters for all species with a â‰¥99% bootstrap support each. Identification was successful for 100% of the species as the minimum genetic distance to the nearest neighbour always exceeded the maximum intraspecific distance. A barcoding gap was apparent for the whole data set. Within-species distances ranged from 0 to 2.35%, while interspecific distances varied between 3.15 and 28.09%. Distances between congeners were on average 51-fold higher than those within species. The validation of the sequence library by applying BOLDs barcode index number (BIN) analysis tool and a ranking system demonstrated high taxonomic reliability of the DNA barcodes for 85% of the investigated fish species. Thus, the sequence library presented here can be confidently used as a benchmark for identification of at least two-thirds of the typical fish species recorded for the North Sea.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rn636/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58931","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58931","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24618145","doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12238"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rn636"}}
