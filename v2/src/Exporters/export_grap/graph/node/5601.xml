Here we present new empirical data that show strong differences in allometric scaling according to whether the resolution at the local scale is based on a taxonomic or a functional classification, whilst only slight differences arise according to soil environmental conditions. For the first time isometry (an inverse 1:1 proportion) is recognized in mass–abundance relationships, providing a functional signal for constant biomass distribution in soil biota regardless of discrete trophic levels. Our findings are in contrast to those from aquatic ecosystems, in that higher trophic levels in soil biota are not a direct function of increasing body mass.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.t5347/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.68970","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.68970","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.t5347"}}
