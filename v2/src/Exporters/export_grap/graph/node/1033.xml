Here we show that outbreak cycles in the tea tortrix Adoxophyes honmai can be explained by temperature-driven changes in system stability. Wavelet analysis of a 51yr time series spanning over 200 outbreaks reveals a threshold in outbreak amplitude each spring when temperature exceeds 15Â°C, and a secession of outbreaks each fall as temperature decreases. This is in close agreement with our independently parameterized mathematical model that predicts the system crosses a Hopf bifurcation from stability to sustained cycles as temperature increases. These results suggest that temperature can alter system stability and provide an explanation for generation cycles in multivoltine insects.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.n11d4/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.n11d4/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52351","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52351","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23907532","doi:10.1126/science.1238477"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.n11d4"}}
