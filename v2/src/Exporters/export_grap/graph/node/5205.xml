Industrial activities, ecological considerations, and goals of The Fish Barcode of Life campaign make it crucial that fish species residing in the park be identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of barcoding data on fishes of the Persian Gulf. 187 individuals representing 76 species, 56 genera, and 32 families were examined. The data flagged potentially cryptic species of Gerres filamentosus and Plectorhincus schotaf. 16S rDNA data on these species are provided. Exclusion of the two species resulted in a mean COI intraspecific distance of 0.18%, and a mean inter-to intra-specific divergence ratio of 66.7. There was no overlap between maximum K2Pdistances among conspecifics (1.66%) and minimum distance among congeneric species (6.19%). Barcodes shared among species were not observed. Neighbor-joining analysis showed that most species formed cohesive sequence units with little variation. Finally, comparison of 16 selected species from this study with metadata of conspecifics from Australia, India, China and South Africa revealed high inter-region divergences and potential existence of six cryptic species. Pairwise inter-regional comparisons were more informative than global divergence assessments with regard to detection of cryptic variation. Our analysis exemplifies optimal use of the expanding barcode data now becoming available.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8274/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8274","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8274","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02989.x","PMID:21481204"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8274"}}
