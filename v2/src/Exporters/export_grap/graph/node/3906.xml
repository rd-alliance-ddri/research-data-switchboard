Here, we report the large-scale identification of direct targets of FUL1 and FUL2 by transcriptome analysis of FUL1/FUL2 suppressed fruits and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) targeting tomato gene promoters. The ChIP-chip and transcriptome analysis identified FUL1/FUL2 target genes that contain at least one genomic region bound by FUL1 or FUL2 (regions that occur mainly in their promoters) and exhibit FUL1/FUL2-dependent expression during ripening. These analyses identified 860 direct FUL1 targets and 878 direct FUL2 targets; this set of genes includes both direct targets of RIN and nontargets of RIN. Functional classification of the FUL1/FUL2 targets revealed that these FUL homologs function in many biological processes via the regulation of ripening-related gene expression, both in cooperation with and independent of RIN. Our in vitro assay showed that the FUL homologs, RIN, and tomato AGAMOUS-LIKE1 form DNA binding complexes, suggesting that tetramer complexes of these MADS box proteins are mainly responsible for the regulation of ripening.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.57838","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.57838","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24415769","doi:10.1105/tpc.113.119453"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.4f7n5"}}
