Sur.  Cruises have been conducted in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA, 3-4 times per year since March, 2001 and are approximately 7 days in length.There are 2 basic types of measurements:Underway measurements: fluorometry, salinity and temperature are collected at a depth of 3m with a flow-through system which also includes continuous atmospheric climate measurements.Underway acoustic doppler current profiles were collected using a RDInstruments Workhorse 300kHz and RDInstruments Ocean Surveyor 75kHz ADCP.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.27849","name":["CraigCarlson","MarkBrzezinski","LibeWashburn","DavidSiegel","SBCLTER","JaniceJones","ChrisGotschalk","DavidSalazar"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.27849","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["knb-lter-sbc.1115.3","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/knb-lter-sbc.1115.3/xml"]}}
