Three taxa are accepted: L. cryophila, L. hodkinsoniana sp. nov., and L. pacifica sp. nov. Both Lepraria crassissima and L. incana are excluded from the study area. Non-cryptic, semi-cryptic, and fully-cryptic species concepts in Lepraria are discussed with a special emphasis on the practical integration of molecular characters into taxonomic frameworks based on non-molecular characters.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37006","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21642343","doi:10.3852/11-032"],"doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.44954v8f"}}
