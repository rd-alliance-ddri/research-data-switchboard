The affinities of\none of the most enigmatic lineages, surf silversides (Notocheiridae), have proven particularly elusive due\nto this taxonâ€™s unique morphology and rarity in museum collections. In this study, we use mitochondrial\nand nuclear sequence data to generate a phylogeny for seven of the eight families of Atheriniformes. Our\nresults reveal that four families within Atheriniformes (Atherinopsidae, Notocheiridae, Atherinidae, Melanotaeniidae) are not monophyletic. Most notably, Notocheiridae is polyphyletic, with Notocheirus hubbsi\nnested within New World silversides (Atherinopsidae), while members of Iso are sister to all other Old\nWorld Atheriniforms. These data suggest that the unique morphology of Notocheirus and Iso is a result\nof adaptive convergent evolution to the high-energy surf habitat where these species live.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gq429f33/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36764","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36764","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2011.12.006","PMID:22178919"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gq429f33"}}
