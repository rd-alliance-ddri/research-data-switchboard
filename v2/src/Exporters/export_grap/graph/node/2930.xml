Here, the origin of snake venom metalloproteinases was rigorously reassessed using phylogenetics and the reconstruction of ancestral sequences. Basal SVMPs are most closely related to ADAM 7, 28 and decysin 1 proteins. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of these proteins and their hypothetical ancestors elucidates progressive alterations in the amino acid composition and structural characteristics of ADAMs/SVMPs through evolutionary time.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fd5q0p68/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.36545","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.36545","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22406471","doi:10.1016/j.toxicon.2012.02.006"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fd5q0p68"}}
