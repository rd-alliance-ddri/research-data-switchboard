We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged refinement, where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation–libration–screw (TLS) model. Modeling of 20 protein datasets at 1.1–3.1 Å resolution reduced cross-validated R_free values by 0.3–4.9%, indicating that ensemble models fit the X-ray data better than single structures. The ensembles revealed that, while most proteins display a well-ordered core, some proteins exhibit a ‘molten core’ likely supporting functionally important dynamics in ligand binding, enzyme activity and protomer assembly. Order–disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues. Thus, ensemble refinement extracts dynamical details from the X-ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding of structure–dynamics–function relationships.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5n01h/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.44133","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.44133","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.7554/eLife.00311","PMID:23251785"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5n01h"}}
