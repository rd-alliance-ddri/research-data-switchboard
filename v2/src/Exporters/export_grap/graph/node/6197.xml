Despite the increasing ease of obtaining such data, using these data effectively still poses notable challenges, especially for those working with organisms without a high-quality reference genome. For every stage of analysis – from assembly to annotation to variant discovery – researchers have to distinguish technical artefacts from the biological realities of their data before they can make inference. In this work, I explore these challenges by generating a large de novo comparative transcriptomic data set data for a clade of lizards and constructing a pipeline to analyse these data. Then, using a combination of novel metrics and an externally validated variant data set, I test the efficacy of my approach, identify areas of improvement, and propose ways to minimize these errors. I find that with careful data curation, HTS can be a powerful tool for generating genomic data for non-model organisms.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.7c99f/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.7c99f/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.44940","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.44940","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12077","PMID:23414390"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7c99f"}}
