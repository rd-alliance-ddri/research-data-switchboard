Cultures in rows A, C, E, and G contain treatments without phage T4rII, cultures in rows B, D, F, and H contain treatments with phage T4rII. E. coli lambda was labelled with pDsRed in columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. E. coli lambda was labelled with pGFP in columns 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. The initial frequency of E. coli lambda was 99.9% in cultures in columns 1 and 2, 99% in cultures in columns 3 and 4, 95% in cultures in columns 5 and 6, 90% in cultures in columns 7 and 8, 50% in cultures in columns 9 and 10, and 10% in cultures in columns 11 and 12.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.46826","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.46826","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.b1q2n/8"}}
