We tested for a difference in the infectivity of viral parasites (lytic phage Î¦2) and resistance of their bacterial hosts (Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25) under both high and low multiplicity of infection (MOI) during coevolution in laboratory microcosms. Results show that MOI has no effect on infectivity and resistance evolution during coevolution over approximately 80 generations of host growth, and this is true when the experiment is initiated with wild-type viruses and hosts, or with viruses and hosts that have already been coevolving for ~330 generations. This suggests that MOI does not have a net effect of accelerating parasite adaptation to hosts through recombination, or retarding adaptation to hosts through between-parasite conflict in this system.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.1fc37c3r/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.1fc37c3r/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35996","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35996","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02434.x","PMID:22168551"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1fc37c3r"}}
