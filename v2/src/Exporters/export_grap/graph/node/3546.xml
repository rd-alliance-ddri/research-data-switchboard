Molecular Ecology Resources, online in advance of print.","keywords":["outliers","local adaptation"],"description":"QST, a measure of quantitative genetic differentiation among populations, is an index that can suggest local adaptation if QST for a trait is sufficiently larger than the mean FST of neutral genetic markers. A previous method by Whitlock and Guillaume derived a simulation resampling approach to statistically test for a difference between QST and FST, but that method is limited to balanced data sets with offspring related as half-sibs through shared fathers. We extend this approach to (1) allow for a model more suitable for some plant populations or breeding designs in which offspring are related through mothers (assuming independent fathers for each offspring; half-sibs by dam), and (2) by explicitly allowing for unbalanced data sets. The resulting approach is made available through the R package QstFstComp.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574/7","doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.65695","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.65695","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25042150","doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12303"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.rm574"}}
