We used mating pairs of individuals from two populations to increase the variances in genital dimensions and determined the copulation performance (insemination and spermatophore replacement, and copulation time) in single- and double-mating situations. In single mating, insemination success was not affected by genital dimensions, although the copulation time was significantly shorter when the male aedeagus was longer. In the double-mating experiment, insemination and replacement of spermatophores by the second male succeeded more frequently when the copulatory piece was shorter and the vaginal appendix was longer, and when the difference between the length of the copulatory piece and the vaginal appendix was smaller. Thus, a matching of the corresponding genital parts between the sexes increases the male's reproductive success in sperm competition, but elongation of the copulatory piece cannot be explained simply by the improvement in male reproductive success. We discuss possible factors for the elongation of genital parts in terms of sexual conflict and reproductive interference through interspecific copulation.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gd0nc/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58058","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58058","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24471576","doi:10.1111/jeb.12323"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.gd0nc"}}
