This issue is here addressed using Bayesian methods which integrate stratigraphical and morphological data to simultaneously infer evolutionary relationships and divergence times. These analyses place the diversification of modern birds in the mid-Cretaceous (~100-110Ma), only slightly more recent than many genetic studies, and congruent with latest molecular estimates.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.c09b0/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.c09b0/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.c09b0/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.50691","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.50691","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24449041","doi:10.1093/sysbio/syt110"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.c09b0"}}
