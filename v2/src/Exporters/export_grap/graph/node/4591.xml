Drosophila neotestacea harbors a heritable symbiont, Spiroplasma, that confers protection against parasitic nematodes. We previously found a cline in Spiroplasma prevalence across central Canada, ending abruptly at the Rocky Mountains. Resampling these populations nine years later revealed that Spiroplasma had increased substantially across the region, resembling a Fisherian wave of advance. Associations between Spiroplasma infection and host mitochondrial DNA indicate that the increase was due to local increase of Spiroplasma-infected flies. Finally, we detected Spiroplasma west of the Rocky Mountains for the first time and showed that defense against nematodes occurs in flies with a western genetic background. Because nematode infection is common throughout D. neotestacea’s range, we expect Spiroplasma to spread to the Pacific coast.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.62294/2","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.45592","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.45592","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/ele.12087","PMID:23517577"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.62294"}}
