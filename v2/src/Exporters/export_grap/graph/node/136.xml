However, the temporal stability of quantitative relationships among diversity, latitude and temperature is largely unknown. Here we document marine zooplankton species diversity patterns at four time slices [modern, Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 years ago), last interglacial (120,000 years ago), and Pliocene (~3.3-3.0 million years ago)] and show that, although the diversity-latitude relationship has been dynamic, diversity-temperature relationships are remarkably constant over the past three million years. These results suggest that species diversity is rapidly reorganized as speciesâ€™ ranges respond to temperature change on ecological time scales, and that the ecological impact of future human-induced temperature change may be partly predictable from fossil and paleoclimatological records.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.dc139/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.dc139/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.dc139/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.dc139/3"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.40165","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.40165","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01828.x","PMID:22738438"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.dc139"}}
