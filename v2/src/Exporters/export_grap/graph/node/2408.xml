In non-human primates, alarm calls typically refer to broad classes of disturbances, in some instances to specific predators. Here, we present the results of a field experiment with a New World primate, the black-fronted titi monkey, designed to explore the information conveyed by their alarm call system. Adults produced sequences consisting of two main alarm call types that conveyed, in different parts of the utterance, information about a predator’s type and location. In particular, sequence compositions differed depending on whether the predator was a mammalian carnivore or a raptor, and whether it was detected in a tree or on the ground. This is the first demonstration of a sequence-based alarm call system in a non-human animal that has the capacity to encode both location and type of predatory threat.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sd1sr/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.52715","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.52715","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1098/rsbl.2013.0535","PMID:24004492"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.sd1sr"}}
