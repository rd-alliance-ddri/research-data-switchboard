Comparing local-clocks (rates of molecular evolution estimated from sets of branches of a phylogenetic tree) is a common tool in this research effort. Here, I show that a commonly used test (the Likelihood Ratio Test, LRT) will not be statistically valid for comparing local-clocks in most cases. Instead, I propose the local-clock permutation test (LCPT), a simple test which can be used to test the significance of differences between local-clocks. The LCPT could also be used to test for differences between any parameter that can be assigned to individual branches on a phylogenetic tree. Using simulated data, I show that the LCPT has good power to detect differences between local-clocks.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7886/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.7886","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.7886","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21272000","doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01160.x"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.7886"}}
