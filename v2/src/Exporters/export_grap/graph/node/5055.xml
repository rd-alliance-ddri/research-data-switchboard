(2014) propose a framework for \"next-generation\" DNA barcoding, whereby multi-locus datasets are coupled with coalescent-based species delimitation methods to make specimen identifications. They claim single-locus DNA barcoding is outdated, and a multilocus approach superior, with their assertions supported by an analysis of 33 species of Sarcophaga flesh flies. Here, we reanalyse their data and show that a standard DNA barcode analysis is in fact capable of identifying 99.8% (all but one) of their Sarcophaga specimens, and that their conclusions misrepresent their data. We also discuss the benefits and drawbacks to their vision of \"next-gen\" barcoding.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.h3g63/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.h3g63/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.65657","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.65657","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1093/sysbio/syu060","PMID:25116917"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.h3g63"}}
