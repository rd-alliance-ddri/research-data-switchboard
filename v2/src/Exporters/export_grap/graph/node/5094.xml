In this study we utilized a series of lake populations of the cyclical parthenogen, Daphnia pulicaria, that vary consistently in their investment in sexual reproduction, to address the questions of whether the ecological variation in investment in sex is detectable at the genetic level, and if so, whether the genetic patterns seen are consistent with theoretical predictions. We show that there is variation in the genetic structure of these populations in a manner consistent with their investment in sexual reproduction. Populations engaging in a high frequency of sex were in Hardy-Weinberg and gametic phase equilibrium, and showed little genotypic differentiation across sampled years. In contrast, populations with a lower frequency of sex deviated widely from equilibrium, had reduced multi-locus clonal diversity, and showed significant temporal genotypic deviation.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2m3k7v74/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35340","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35340","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01488.x","PMID:22380451"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2m3k7v74"}}
