Native herbivores often colonise non-native plants, potentially reducing invasion success or causing economic loss to introduced agricultural crops. We developed a predictive model to forecast novel interactions and verified it with a data set containing hundreds of observed novel plant–insect interactions. Using a food network of 900 native European butterfly and moth species and 1944 native plants, we built an herbivore host-use model. By extrapolating host use from the native herbivore–plant food network, we accurately forecasted the observed novel use of 459 non-native plant species by native herbivores. Patterns that governed herbivore host breadth on co-evolved native plants were equally important in determining non-native hosts. Our results make the forecasting of novel herbivore communities feasible in order to better understand the fate and impact of introduced plants.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.1tm84/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.1tm84/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.1tm84/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.1tm84/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.1tm84/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.50842","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.50842","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23800217","doi: 10.1111/ele.12143"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1tm84"}}
