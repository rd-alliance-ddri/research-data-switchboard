Here, we use a laboratory-based mesocosm experiment to quantify pre- and post-mating selection on female secondary sexual traits in the Gulf pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli), a sexually dimorphic, sex-role-reversed species in which ornamented females compete for access to choosy males. We calculate selection differentials and gradients on female traits, including ornament area, ornament number, and body size for three episodes of selection related to female reproductive success (number of mates, number of eggs transferred, and number of surviving embryos). Selection is strong on both ornament area and ornament size, and the majority of selection occurs during the pre-mating episode of selection. Interestingly, selection on female body size, which has been detected in previous studies of Gulf pipefish, appears to be indirect, as evidenced by a multivariate analysis of selection gradients. Our results show that sexual selection favors either many bands or larger bands in female Gulf pipefish.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fg7ps/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.70138","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.70138","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.fg7ps"}}
