Measurements were collected using a StowAway Tidbit Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. TBIC32+4+27) beginning 2006-05-06.  The instrument depth was 010 meters, in an overall water depth of 60 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.21413","name":["PatrickDrake","MargaretMcManus","Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.21413","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["TPT007_060MTBD010R00_20060506.50.8","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/TPT007_060MTBD010R00_20060506.50.8/xml"]}}
