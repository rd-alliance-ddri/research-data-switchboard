We also present 16 morphological characters for phylogenetic analysis. Our analyses yielded poorly-supported nodes deep in the anole tree but many well-supported nodes for more recent phylogenetic divergences. We test the hypothesis that the major clades of anoles form a hard polytomy and present a general statistical framework for testing hypothesis of simultaneous branching of lineages by using molecular sequence data. Our results suggest that rapid diversification early in the evolutionary history of anoles explains why numberous researchers have had difficulty reconstruction well-supported dichotomous phylogenetic trees for anoles.","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.412","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1080/106351599260283","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.412"}}
