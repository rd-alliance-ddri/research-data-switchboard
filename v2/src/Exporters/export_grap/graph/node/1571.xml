We used model based comparative methods to reconstruct karyotype evolution and the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes onto a newly generated Anolis phylogeny. We found that heteromorphic sex chromosomes evolved multiple times in the genus. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of repetitive DNA showed variable rates of Y chromosome degeneration among Anolis species and identified previously undetected, homomorphic sex chromosomes in two species. We confirmed homology of sex chromosomes in the genus by performing FISH of an X-linked BAC and qPCR of X-linked genes in multiple Anolis species sampled across the phylogeny. Taken together, these results are consistent with long-term conservation of sex chromosomes in the group. Our results pave the way to address additional questions related to Anolis sex chromosome evolution and describe a conceptual framework that can be used to evaluate the origins and evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in other clades.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.dp848.2/3.1","doi:10.5061/dryad.dp848.2/2.1","doi:10.5061/dryad.dp848.2/1.1","doi:10.5061/dryad.dp848.2/4.1"],"identifier_uri":["http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.61367","http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.56859"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.61367","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24279795","doi:10.1111/evo.12328"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.dp848.2"}}
