To provide a rapid identification technique for this pathogen in support of official control measures, a nested polymerase chain reaction–based diagnostic assay that employs species-specific primer sets has been developed. The assay is able to detect the presence of the pathogen direct from pine needles, irrespective of host species, to within 10 fg of target DNA, the equivalent of approximately 2–3 ascospores or hyphael cells.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8296/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.8296","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.8296","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1755-0998.2011.02996.x","PMID:21676203"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8296"}}
