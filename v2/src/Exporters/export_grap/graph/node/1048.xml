We used previously-published genotype data for 8 microsatellite DNA loci from 930 brown bears in 19 populations and 473 polar bears in 16 populations to compare the population genetic relationships of extant populations of the species. Genetic distances (Nei standard distance = 1.157), the proportion of private alleles (52% of alleles are not shared by the species), and Bayesian cluster analysis are consistent with morphological and  life history characteristics that distinguish polar bears and brown bears as different species with little or no gene flow among extant populations.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q30rt/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.43939","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.43939","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1093/jhered/ess090","PMID:23125409"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q30rt"}}
