The prevalence of bacterial endosymbionts and their role in scorpion evolution have rarely been investigated. In this study, 61 samples from 40 species of scorpion in the family Vaejovidae were screened for the presence of the bacterial endosymbionts Cardinium, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma and Wolbachia. No samples were infected by these bacteria. However, one primer pair specifically designed to amplify Rickettsia amplified nontarget genes of other taxa. Similar off-target amplification using another endosymbiont-specific primer was also found during preliminary screenings. Results caution against the overreliance on previously published screening primers to detect bacterial endosymbionts in host taxa and suggest that primer specificity may be higher in primers targeting nuclear rather than mitochondrial genes.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.40pt8/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.57813","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.57813","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24373187","doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12220"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.40pt8"}}
