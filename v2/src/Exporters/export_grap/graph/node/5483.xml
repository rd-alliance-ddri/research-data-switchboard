A recent molecular phylogenetic evaluation of the group identified a number of problems with respect to how species and species groups were delineated by Bond and Platnick in their 2007 taxonomic revision of the genus. We report herein the discovery of a new species, Myrmekiaphila tigris sp. n. The phylogenetic position of the species is evaluated using a molecular phylogenetic approach based on a set of mtDNA markers. Our preferred phylogenetic hypothesis supports the recognition of a new species and further highlights the need to more carefully investigate species boundaries within the genus. These results further indicate that palpal bulb morphology is rapidly evolving and has likely been a contributing factor in rendering a number of species paraphyletic with respect to the molecular data.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.pk24v/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.pk24v/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.pk24v/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.pk24v/4"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.39326","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.39326","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.3897/zookeys.190.3011","PMID:22639533"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.pk24v"}}
