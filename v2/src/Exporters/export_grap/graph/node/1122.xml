However, measurements of the relative magnitude of the fitness benefits that such choice can confer are lacking. Here we directly measured, in a comprehensive set of tests that manipulated key variables, the fitness benefits of male mate choice in Drosophila melanogaster, by measuring egg production in females that were chosen or rejected by males. The results provided significant evidence for male mate choice. In absolute terms, the observed degree of choice increased male fitness by an average of only 1.59 eggs. However, using a novel technique we show that this benefit of choice represented 14.5% of the maximum potential fitness benefit of choice. The magnitude of mate choice was not significantly altered by variation in (i) mate compatibility, (ii) phenotypic plasticity in male mate choice, or (iii) whether choosing males were preferred or non-preferred by females. Overall, we show that male mate choice represents a subtle but significant opportunity for sexual selection, and we offer a novel and widely applicable method for quantifying mate choice.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5m2671qf/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.38450","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38450","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01648.x","PMID:22834761"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5m2671qf"}}
