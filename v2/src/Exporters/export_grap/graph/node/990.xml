Frogs were observed all year round but despite the lack of limited climatic seasonality in the region it was possible to observe a high activity period between January-May and a lower activity period between June-December. Freshly laid eggs were found in all months except November, and with highest incidence between January and May, while calling was heard in all months. We found a positive correlation between daily adult counts and minimum air temperature. On the contrary rainfall did not significantly predict activity, although boosts of calling and egg-laying especially in the austral winter were observed after heavy rainfall events. We define D. antongilii in Maroantsetra as a sporadic wet season breeder that reproduces at irregular intervals following heavy rain events.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5h52h/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.44391","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.44391","isReferencedBy":"http://www.fupress.net/index.php/ah/article/view/11139","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.5h52h"}}
