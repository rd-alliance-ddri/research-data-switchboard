Yet, the effects of mating partner on recombination rates have not been considered. Here, I document a previously undescribed male-mediated effect on female recombination rates. After crossing females to males from different genetic backgrounds, I observed a significant difference in proportion of recombinant offspring based on the genetic background of the father (p=0.0292; 3 df; F=3.07). Genetic variation in male ability to affect recombination rate in their mates suggests the potential for sexual conflict on optimal proportion of recombinant offspring, perhaps leading to changes in population-level recombination rates with varying levels of sexual selection.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.792g75qr/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35391","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35391","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01493.x","PMID:22380449"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.792g75qr"}}
