Rather than taking the common approach of comparing different populations or sites, here we studied gene flow via wind-mediated effective pollen dispersal on the same plant individuals before and after a fire-induced population drop, in a natural stand of Pinus halepensis. The fire killed 96% of the pine trees in the stand and cleared the vegetation in the area. Thirteen trees survived in two groups separated by ~80 m, and seven of these trees had serotinous (closed) pre-fire cones that did not open despite the fire. We analyzed pollen from closed pre- and post-fire cones using microsatellites. The two groups of surviving trees were highly genetically differentiated, and the pollen they produced also showed strong among-group differentiation and very high kinship both before and after the fire, indicating limited and very local pollen dispersal. The pollen not produced by the survivors also showed significant pre-fire spatial genetic structure and high kinship, indicating mainly within-population origin and limited gene flow from outside, but became spatially homogeneous with random kinship after the fire. We suggest that post-fire gene flow via wind-mediated pollen dispersal increased by two putative mechanisms: 1) a drastic reduction in local pollen production due to population thinning, effectively increasing pollen immigration; 2) an increase in wind speeds in the vegetation-free post-fire landscape. This research shows that dispersal can alleviate negative genetic effects of population size reduction, and that disturbances might enhance gene flow, rather than reduce it.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.28kh9/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53358","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53358","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24128259","doi:10.1111/mec.12506"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.28kh9"}}
