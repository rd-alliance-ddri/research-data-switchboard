METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven polymorphic loci were isolated using a pyrosequencing-based protocol. The seven loci were successfully amplified on three different morphotypes of S. trimera. For six of the seven loci, there is at least one private allele for one of the three morphotypes. The mean effective number of alleles is about four for each of the three morphotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These microsatellite markers are promising to explore the genetic delimitation among sympatric morphotypes found in Gabonese forests and to study the spatial genetic structure within each gene pool.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.dp380n8s/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.38509","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38509","isReferencedBy":["PMID:22847541","doi:10.3732/ajb.1200041"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.dp380n8s"}}
