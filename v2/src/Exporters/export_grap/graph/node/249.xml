Recent evidence suggests that seasonal changes in auditory processing are coincident with seasonal variation in vocal output. Here we show for the first time that frequency selectivity and temporal resolution of the songbird auditory periphery change seasonally and in a sex-specific manner. Male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus) did not differ in their frequency sensitivity during the non-breeding season, nor did they differ in their temporal resolution. In contrast, female house sparrows showed enhanced frequency selectivity during the breeding season which was matched by a concomitant reduction of temporal resolution. However, males failed to show seasonal plasticity in either of these auditory properties. We discuss potential mechanisms generating these seasonal patterns and the implications of sex-specific seasonal changes in auditory processing for vocal communication.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.31nd3/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.43644","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.43644","isReferencedBy":["PMID:23193125","doi:10.1098/rspb.2012.2296"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.31nd3"}}
