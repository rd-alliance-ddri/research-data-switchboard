Gypsy moths infected by a baculovirus climb to the top of trees to die, liquefy, and “rain” virus on the foliage below to infect new hosts. The viral gene that manipulates climbing behavior of the host was identified, providing evidence of a genetic basis for the extended phenotype.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.36530/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.34403","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.34403","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21903803","doi:10.1126/science.1209199"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.36530"}}
