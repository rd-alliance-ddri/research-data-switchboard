We studied how plant inbreeding affects herbivore oviposition preference, and whether inbreeding of both plants and herbivores alter the probability of predation or parasitism of herbivore eggs. In a laboratory preference test with the specialist herbivore moth Abrostola asclepiadis and inbred and outbred Vincetoxicum hirundinaria plants, we discovered that herbivores preferred to oviposit on outbred plants. A field experiment with inbred and outbred plants that bore inbred or outbred herbivore eggs revealed that the eggs of the outbred herbivores were more likely to be lost by predation, parasitism or plant hypersensitive responses than inbred eggs. This difference did not lead to differences in the realized fecundity as the number of hatched larva did not differ between inbred and outbred herbivores. Thus, the strength of inbreeding depression in herbivores decreases when their natural enemies are involved. Plant inbreeding did not alter the attraction of natural enemies of the eggs. We conclude that inbreeding can significantly alter the interactions of plants and herbivores at different life-history stages, and that some of these alterations are mediated by the natural enemies of the herbivores.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.0qg71/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.0qg71/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.69784","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.69784","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.0qg71"}}
