However, it is difficult to separate these factors and detect the effects of selection when two or more contrasting selective factors are simultaneously acting on a single locus. In the damselfly Ischnura senegalensis, females exhibit color dimorphism and morph frequencies change geographically. We here evaluated the role of selection and stochastic factors in population divergence of morph frequencies by comparing the divergences in color locus and neutral loci. Comparisons between population pairwise FST for neutral loci and for the color locus did not detect any stochastic factors affecting color locus. Although comparison between population divergence in color and neutral loci using all populations detected only divergent selection, we detected two antagonistic selective factors acting on the color locus, that is, balancing and divergent selection, when considering geographical distance between populations. Our results suggest that a combination of two antagonistic selective factors, rather than stochastic factors, establishes the geographic cline in morph frequency in this system.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.08h3j/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.08h3j/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.54193","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.54193","isReferencedBy":["doi:10.1038/hdy.2013.117","PMID:24281546"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.08h3j"}}
