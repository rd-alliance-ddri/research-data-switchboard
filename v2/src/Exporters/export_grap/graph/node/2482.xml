Approximately 85 per cent (42 of 49 orthologue comparisons) of the regional differences in the dog are similar to those that differentiate the analogous human brain regions. A smaller percentage of human differences were replicated in the dog, particularly in the cortex, which may generally be evolving more rapidly than other brain regions in mammals. This study lays the foundation for detailed analysis of the population structure of transcriptional variation as it relates to cognitive and neurological phenotypes in the domestic dog.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.964/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.964/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.964/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.964/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.964/1"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.964","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.964","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.964"}}
