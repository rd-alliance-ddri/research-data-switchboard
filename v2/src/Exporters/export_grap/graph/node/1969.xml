A dense array of 5,844 single nucleotide polymorphisms was used to directly construct a genomic relationship matrix (G) that had four elements ranging from 0.17 to 0.24, between five intra-provenance base parents. Adjusting the numerator relationship matrix for this relatedness among base parents produced inbreeding coefficients of F i ≈ 0.1 in their offspring, which displayed depressed height growth. Accounting for inbreeding level as a covariate in a mixed model decreased grossly overestimated (up to 2 ×) dominance variance in models without the covariate adjustment. Height growth decreased 39 cm (∼ 6 %) for every 0.1 increase in F i .","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9m63g/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.53450","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.53450","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1007/s11295-013-0676-y","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.9m63g"}}
