These frogs as small, inconspicuous, and of high superficial morphological similarity. We here formulate a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships and assess the amount of genetic variation among genealogical lineages on the basis of 536bp of mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences. Combining molecular data with a study of morphology, morphometric divergence and geographical proximity, we tested hypotheses of species identity. We (1) used character-based and morphometric analyses to assign thee type specimens of species in Lalos available to us to respectively one of the main clades, in order to propose the best potential correct taxonomic and nomenclatural allocation for the individuals included in the molecular study, and (2) tried to also assign the historical museum specimens to these molecular taxonomic units and to reclassify them whenever necessary. We also used the molecular data to match tadpoles with adults and provide tadpole descriptions for species of which these larvae were previously unknown. Specimens that could neither be allocated to a molecular group (on the basis of their DNA “barcode”) nor to a type specimen via morphometry are described here as new species. Based on this integrative set of data and analyses we describe two new species, Leptolalax eos n. sp. and Leptolalax nyx n. sp., we resurrect Leptolalax minimus, and reassess the distribution of the species studied. We propose changes in the Red List status of L. pelodytoides and L. ventripunctatus and suggest a conservation status for the new species described herein.","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cc454m37/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.35617","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.35617","isReferencedBy":"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/772133313","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.cc454m37"}}
