Due to challenges posed by the clonal nature of MAE, very little is known about its regulation; in particular, no molecular features have been specifically linked to MAE. Here we report an approach that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy: a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. The MAE signature is present in ~20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.1775k/12","doi:10.5061/dryad.1775k/11","doi:10.5061/dryad.1775k/10","doi:10.5061/dryad.1775k/13"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.56009","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.56009","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24381246","doi:10.7554/eLife.01256"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.1775k"}}
