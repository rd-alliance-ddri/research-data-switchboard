Measurements were collected using StowAway Tidbit Temperature Loggers (Onset Computer Corp. TBIC32+4+27) beginning 2003-05-01.  The instrument depth was 009 meters, in an overall water depth of 015 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.31039","name":["LibeWashburn","ChrisGotschalk","Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)"],"oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.31039","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","identifier":["TRLXXX_015MTBD009R00_20030501.50.5","http://metacat.lternet.edu/knb/metacat/TRLXXX_015MTBD009R00_20030501.50.5/xml"]}}
