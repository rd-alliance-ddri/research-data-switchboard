Its widespread occurrence is in contrast with theoretical predictions that it should evolve only under rather special circumstances.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.2jv25/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.2jv25/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.57988","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.57988","isReferencedBy":["PMID:24410284","doi:10.1111/evo.12349"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.2jv25"}}
