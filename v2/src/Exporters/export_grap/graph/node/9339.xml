This experiment is located in fields A, B, and C.  There are 3 treatments, 2 nitrogen levels and a control.  The treatments are E, G, and I as defined in <A HREF=\"http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html\">fertilization details</A> under the \"microplot\" category.  There are 16 reps of the 3 treatments for a total of 48 plots in each field.  Treatments are randomly assigned to the plots.  The plots are 4 by 4 meters and are laid out in a 6 by 8 grid with 1 meter aisles.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in files trmte11. In 1987, experiment E053 was established on top of E011 in field C. For a list of treatments, see E053.  Also is 1992, experiment (Walt Carson's) was established on top of E011 in field C. <!For a list of treatments, see E1??.> In the spring of 1992, experiment <A HREF=\"http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e100/e100.html\">E100</A> was established on top of E011, in fields A, and B.
