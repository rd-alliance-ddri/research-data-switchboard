We tested the relationship of these two diversity levels at local and regional geographic scales. Local genetic and species diversity showed parallel patterns influenced by the number of plant communities. Likewise, at regional level there was strong evidence for parallel equilibrial dynamics of genotypes and species. However, a superimposed matrix effect enhanced the regional species diversity only. Genetic diversity of habitat specialist organisms and species diversity of these limestone outcrop islands on mainland are modulated by parallel landscape-level processes at different geographic scales, and mechanisms may be identified at very high spatial resolutions.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.8b3d1/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.8b3d1/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58659","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58659","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1016/j.ecocom.2014.01.001","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.8b3d1"}}
