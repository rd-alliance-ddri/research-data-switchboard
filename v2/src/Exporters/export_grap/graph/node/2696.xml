They have variety of functions including contributions to hemostasis. In this study, five serine protease were cloned and characterized from two different cDNA libraries. Factor V activator (RVV-V), alpha fibrinogenase (RVAF) and beta fibrinogenase (RVBF) from Russell’s viper (Daboia russelli siamensis), and plasminogen activator (APL-PA) and protein C activator (APL-C) from Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma. The snake venom serine proteases were clustered in phylogenetic tree according to their functions. KA/KS values suggested that accelerated evolution has occurred in the mature protein-coding regions in cDNAs of snake venom serine proteases.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.tv8ph/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.tv8ph/2"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.33752","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.33752","isReferencedBy":["PMID:21640745","doi:10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.05.014"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.tv8ph"}}
