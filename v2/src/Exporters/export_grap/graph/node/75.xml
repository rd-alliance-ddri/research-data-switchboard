Methods and Results: Illumina sequencing of a shotgun library from S. gigantea identified ca. 1900 putative single-copy loci. Fourteen loci were subsequently shown to be amplifiable, single-copy, and variable in a broad range of Solidago species. Conclusions: The utility of these markers both across the genus and in herbarium specimens of a wide age range will facilitate numerous inter- and intraspecific studies in the ca. 120 Solidago species","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.72p7k/1","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.58105","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.58105","isReferencedBy":["PMID:25202617","doi:10.3732/apps.1300093"],"node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.72p7k"}}
