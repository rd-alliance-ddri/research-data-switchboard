Despite its importance to crop yield, the role of phosphorus (P) with respect to ecological stoichiometry and soil C sequestration in paddy fields remains poorly understood, which limits our ability to predict nutrient-related soil C cycling. Here, we collected soil samples from a paddy field experiment after 7 years of superphosphate application along a gradient of 0, 30, 60, 90 (P-0 through P-90, respectively) kg P ha-1 y-1 in order to evaluate the role of exogenous P on soil C sequestration through regulating microbial stoichiometry. P fertilization increased soil total organic C and labile organic C by 1-14% and 4-96%, respectively, while rice yield is a function of the activities of soil Î²-1, 4-glucosidase (BG), acid phosphatase (AP) and the level of available soil P through a stepwise linear regression model. P input induced C limitation as reflected by decreases in the ratios of C:P in soil and microbial biomass. An ecoenzymatic ratio indicating microbial investment in C versus P acquisition, i.e., ln(BG):ln(AP), changed the ecological function of microbial C acquisition and was stoichiometrically related to P input. This mechanism drove a shift in soil resource availability by increasing bacterial community richness and diversity, and stimulated soil C sequestration in the paddy field by enhancing C degradation-related bacteria for the breakdown of plant-derived carbon sources. Therefore, the decline in the C:P stoichiometric ratio of soil microorganism biomass under P input was beneficial for soil C sequestration, which offered a \"win-win\" relationship for the maximum balance point between C sequestration and P availability for rice production in the face of climate change.","constituent":["doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/2","doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/1","doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/4","doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/3","doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/6","doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/5","doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c/7"],"identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.69031","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.69031","isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1890/14-0189.1","node_type":"Record","node_source":"Dryad","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.6m11c"}}
