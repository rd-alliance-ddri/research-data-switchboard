Testes mass was found to be insensitive to social cues of future mating competition for both major and minor males. Major males allocated more to body condition when exposed to rivals, a response expected for a species in which the outcome of dyadic contests strongly affect male reproductive success.

Strategic allocation to pre-copulatory contest competition did not come at a cost to male investment in sperm competition, suggesting that males may trade investment into contest competition against some other life history trait, such as longevity.

Sexual selection on males may also lead some males to avoid expenditure on secondary sexual traits and achieve copulations using alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). Secondary sexual traits can increase or decrease fitness in males, depending on which ART they employ, generating intralocus tactical conflict that can be ameliorated through male dimorphism. Due to the evolutionary forces acting against intralocus sexual and tactical conflicts, male dimorphism could coevolve with sexual dimorphism, a hypothesis that we tested by investigating these dimorphisms across 48 harvestman species. Using three independently derived phylogenies we consistently found that the evolution of sexual dimorphism was correlated with that of male dimorphism, and suggest that the major force behind this relationship is the similarity between selection against intralocus sexual conflict and selection against intralocus tactical conflict. We also found that transitions in male dimorphism were more likely in the presence of sexual dimorphism, indicating that if a sexually selected trait arises on an autosome and is expressed in both sexes, its suppression in females probably evolves earlier than its suppression in small males that adopt ARTs.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.60145","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.60145","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q8v8v","author":["Buzatto, Bruno Alves","Tomkins, Joseph L.","Machado, Glauco","Simmons, Leigh W."],"isReferencedBy":["PMID:24593685","doi:10.1111/evo.12395"],"constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.q8v8v/1"}},{"id":"264733","labels":["Web","Researcher"],"properties":{"key":"http://www.ceb.uwa.edu.au/research/researchers/bruno-buzatto","node_type":"Researcher","node_source":"Web","url":"http://www.ceb.uwa.edu.au/research/researchers/bruno-buzatto","name":"Bruno Buzatto"}},{"id":"56487","labels":["Dryad","Publication"],"properties":{"key":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.38966","title":"Data from: Paternal effects on the expression of a male polyphenism","host":"Buzatto BA, Simmons LW, Tomkins JL (2012) Paternal effects on the expression of a male polyphenism.

Original sperm competition theory assumed that males trade expenditure on searching for mates for expenditure on the ejaculate, and predicted that males should increase their expenditure on the ejaculate in response to increased risk of competition. A recent extension of this theory has modeled pre-copulatory expenditure in terms of direct contest competition, and predicts that when the gains from marginal investment in weaponry are large, males might be expected to allocate resources to armaments even at the expense of the ejaculate. 2. Here we examine socially cued plasticity in allocation to pre- (body condition) and post-copulatory (testes mass) traits in a male dimorphic beetle, Onthophagus taurus, where major males fight for access to females and minor males obtain reproductive success via sperm competition. Both male morphs were either reared in social isolation or exposed to rivals during the period of sexual maturation following adult emergence. 3. Testes mass was found to be insensitive to social cues of future mating competition for both major and minor males. Major males allocated more to body condition when exposed to rivals, a response expected for a species in which the outcome of dyadic contests strongly affect male reproductive success. In contrast, minor male allocation to condition was insensitive to social cues. 4. Our data illustrate how socially cued plasticity in pre- and post-copulatory traits can depend on the relative importance of these episodes of selection for individual male fitness. In O. taurus dung beetles, males strategically adjusted the amount of resources they allocated to winning pre-copulatory contests over access to females. Strategic allocation to pre-copulatory contest competition did not come at a cost to male investment in sperm competition, suggesting that males may trade investment into contest competition against some other life history trait, such as longevity. The lack of plasticity in testes size suggests that selection from sperm competition may be a relatively constant feature of this species mating system.","identifier_uri":"http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.55230","oai":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.55230","doi":"doi:10.5061/dryad.42pg7","author":["Buzatto, Bruno A.","Simmons, Leigh W."],"isReferencedBy":"doi:10.1111/1365-2435.12211","constituent":"doi:10.5061/dryad.42pg7/1"}},{"id":"264733","labels":["Web","Researcher"],"properties":{"key":"http://www.ceb.uwa.edu.au/research/researchers/bruno-buzatto","node_type":"Researcher","node_source":"Web","url":"http://www.ceb.uwa.edu.au/research/researchers/bruno-buzatto","name":"Bruno Buzatto"}},{"id":"76608","labels":["Dryad","Publication"],"properties":{"key":"oai:datadryad.org:10255/dryad.37317","title":"Data from: Genetic variation underlying the expression of a polyphenism","host":"Buzatto BA, Simmons LW, Tomkins JL (2012) Data from: Genetic variation underlying the expression of a polyphenism.

These 'alternative tactics' often involve males fighting for females or avoiding fights and sneaking matings. The tactics are frequently associated with extreme differences in body plan. The theory and empirical evidence relating to the evolution of alternative tactics has recently been challenged. This proposal aims to address this criticism by testing recent theoretical advances concerning how ecology influences the genetics of alternative tactics. In addition, these divergent life-histories within a species and a single sex, present a unique and powerful tool for testing key evolutionary questions. We will exploit this opportunity.","identifier_purl":"http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/DP0663746","subject_notes":"Investigators: Dr JL Tomkins; Dr NR LeBas; Prof JS Kotiaho; A/Prof JW Radwan\n\t\t\t\tScheme: Discovery Projects\n\t\t\t\tFunding: $AUD 185,000.00\n\t\t\t\tApplication Year: 2005\n\t\t\t\tFirst Year: 2006","subject_Community Benefit":"This research is focussed at the highest level in the field of evolutionary biology; testing recent theory for the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics and using these species to test hypotheses about adaptation.
